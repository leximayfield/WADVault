	"description": "Revenant's Sand Cakes is a level where you are surrounded by revenants and cyberdemons. You will need to be quick about getting invulnerability orbs (you only get 1 per wave) or it is game over. I would love to see others UV Max this level. Music comes from level 8 of episode 2 of Duke Nukem 3D. My demo can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omye7_cf-No",
