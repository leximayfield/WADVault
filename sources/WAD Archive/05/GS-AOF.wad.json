There is a platform in the center of the area with weapons galore. Once there , defend yourself from others who hide in one of the 4 corner areas. The corners are blackened to provide a hiding spot (but transporting from the center, you'll appear behind the other guy. Then you launch off a couple rockets and viola! He's toast! Also, if your careful , you'll notice some \"false\" walls that have been placed where you can DRILL your opponent and laugh 'till tomorrow! :)",
