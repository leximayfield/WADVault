	"description": "An old weapon originally made for a cancelled \"Household Oddities\" where I made weapons out of random household objects. This one is from a set of 4 in total. This was made over half a year ago, so the quality isn't the greatest, though I also don't feel the need to make a new one. Also, I don't remember who/where the hitting/swinging sound is from, because it was sent to me via PM on the old Skulltag forums. I think the hand template was lifted off the ZDoom Forums, so thanks for that as well.",
