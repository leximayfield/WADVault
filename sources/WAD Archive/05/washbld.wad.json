	"description": "Lots of blood... But you may have already gotten that. The story behind this wad (and all the others I mentioned earlier) is this: the foundations of these wads date back to 1996 (the levels will reflect that, I'm sure). That was the year a friend and I started modding and building our own levels. Thirteen years later, after seeing that an active community for Doom still exists, and coming across the wonderfully versatile Doombuilder, I decided to polish off my creations and release them into the world and see how they'd fare. Isn't that what art really implies?",
