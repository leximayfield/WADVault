	"description": "You are in a hot place hotter than thailand, the bricks glow red the lava sweat runs down your face you feel the fear of fright and the news is not all that good. Your mission is to show respect to the solders, bald rifel men, little chocolate guys, pink gorillas a KaKoKa ball and a big monster in the exit room. You are bound to be doomed in this wicked level which has good gameplay this time unlike my older levels. Oh there is a bald terminator guy with a minigun and neat littel men in blue suits and 1920's hats that fire guns at you. I also try to make the level not only play good but also look very good, with 3 keys, good texture alignment and gradent liteing in the map and if ur not happy, you can modify this map to make it your dream level, you can do anything you want you can install an Osram or Sylvania ligt glob in the starting room to make it brighter. I better get back to reading my book about the Kahran and beating my sister up with using my G String as a whip!",
