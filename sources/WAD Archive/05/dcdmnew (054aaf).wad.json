	"description": "Small d-match only wad made to avoid camping. Based upon the Destruction Comes wad. Be careful mouse players! The spiral staircase has a rocket on top. I have been fragged multiple times by a lowly keyboard player because of it. Learn to be a mouse + keyboard player. :-) Hope you enjoy this newest and last revision of the Destruction Comes DEATHMATCH wad.",
