	"description": "This is another small intense deathmatch level. Best suited for altdeath, It contains all of the weapons, a little of health, and no armor. This level features a couple of neat weapon placements (including my own personal favorite, the disarming BFG). Its winding double-back corridors and snipers nest suggest a campers paradise, but instead this level produces intense non-stop frag-fests (just like it's supposed to).",
