	"description": "DECEPTIVE - Sometimes the best things in life are free... NOT! I don't have a story-line or an intro, this is DOOM, not a movie. How does one end up in this Hellish environment? Who cares? Deal with it. DECEPTIVE (a replacement for DOOM 2 map 01) was designed to be used in conjunction with the DEHACKED 2.1 patch. This patch improves weapon efficiency, allows a few extra rounds (you WILL need them...) and adjusts your adversaries to compensate for your increased lethality. ;) This is not to say that the patch will turn you into Captain Blaster in Mega-Monster land, but you will see a difference. Much effort has been put into retaining playability - if you have any suggestions, likes or dislikes, please e-mail me and I'll try to take them into consideration on my next DEHACK.",
