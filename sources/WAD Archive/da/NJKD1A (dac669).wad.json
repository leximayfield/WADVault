	"description": "Olde replacement for Knee Deep in the Dead - my second \"Mega-ish\" WAD. Released purely because of interest in old, cheesy 1994 WADS. This is not the first version of this file, but the first revision. I no longer have the original which would be a month or so older. The file date may or may not be accurate. Both the original and this revised file were originally uploaded to the Compuserve action games forum in 1994.",
