	"description": "A 2-bit ripple counter, built using WadC. Based on the design of Fraggle's binary ripple counter from 2006. The code can generate counters of arbitrary bit-depth. I originally thought to upload a demo of an 8-bit counter (to be different to Fraggle's example) but there's already a built-by-hand 8-bit counter (8-bitadd). So instead I downgraded it to 2 bit and added a surprise for when the counter overflows.",
