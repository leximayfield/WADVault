	"description": "This map is a result of my ponderance upon things like the catacombs of Portland, OR. and the Underground City of Seattle, WA. Combined with a recurrent 90's dream involving a dark highway at night: And the Volcanic residence of Lilanni, the sister of Pele' whom still seeks to help her Sister to find her lost love. And whom will still make herself known to those of a pure heart whom seek her. (The DM's will start here). With the level Culminating at a local sea harbor. In this map I also sought to employ most, but not all of the Special Effects which I have learned through study of other wads.",
