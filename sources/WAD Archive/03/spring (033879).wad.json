	"description": "On a remote, class M planet, is a colony, established to manage an uncommon source of fresh water, a site known as Wellsping. The infection of Wellspring, by the evil minions of Satan has resulted in the seizure of the pumping plant. The plant's water and power are being used to clone members of the hoard. Now the colony is without life sustaining water and the evil side is polluting the only source of water in this sector. Your mission is clear, teleport in, eradicate the evil, and restore the operation of the pumping station. If so much as one evil spore remains, your mission is a failure",
