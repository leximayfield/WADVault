Now if you get bored of the normal hunt/find/kill you can turn it into a strobe match: find your enemy by catching a glimpse of him while the lights flash, or find him by following that shadow in front of the wall lighting units. Don't know how to turn on the strobe mode? Well, I guess you'll figure it out eventually. Send me some E-Mail and let me know what you think.",
