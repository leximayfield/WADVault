	"description": "Info: This is a large tech-themed map that takes place in the UAC's internal headquarters. As for difficulty, I'd say it's Story: After battling your way through area after area of the UAC's numerous bases, you arrive at their internal headquarters. As usual, the base is infested with demons. But something's different about this place. This is where the invasion began, and the monsters are more numerous than ever! It's time to put a stop to this madness once and for all. Additional info: Making this map was quite an undertaking. I didn't want to release it until I was absolutely satisfied with it (although it's still not perfect, of course). Sometimes I remade entire areas multiple times until I was satisfied with the result. Despite these difficulties, I can say that I love Doom mapping, and I hope to release many more maps in the future. In the past, I kept the wads I made to myself, but I'll be releasing the ones I'm most satisfied with in from this time forth.",
