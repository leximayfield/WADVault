	"description": "You watch as the rats fight each other over your latest meal of scraps, viciously battling for survival. You fought like that once. Such a desperate battle was fought (and won) by you 12 years ago: when the UAC, nowadays the largest company in existence, experimented with interdimensional travel. An experiment that went wrong, sending you to hell and back before ridding earth of the evil invading force that had held it captive.",
