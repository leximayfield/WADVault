	"description": "For whatever reason I recently got the inspiration to make another Doom map after about 24 months of not touching an editor. This one actually turned out really well, at least I think so. The title of this wad is kind of misleading, it's really not entirely E1-styled, but there's definitely some influences, especially as far as texturing goes. Who the hell am I kidding, nobody reads this, go play the damn level",
