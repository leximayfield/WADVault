	"description": "A sort of E1-styled map. This was made for a number of things, but never got released, so I'm releasing it as a single map. It's not very new, and I had to tweak it a bit (it was way too hard), but I'm pretty happy with it. It's the first map in years I've fully completed. I've updated it by making it a bit harder. I added more enemies and two Barons of Hell at the end. NOTE: Please don't jump if you're using a port that has jumping. This level wasn't designed for it.",
