	"description": "The final chapter of \"The Inquisitor\" trilogy, that tells us the adventures of the Doom marine in the land of Khorus. Our hero has to correct the mistake, committed by him before the court of King of Krondor, and to put an end to a terrible curse that envelops the land of Khorus for more than 20 years. Our hero is free to choose the path of his own evolution. What he will become at the end of his adventures - a great warrior, a skilled magician, a wise paladin, or he'll prefer to develop himself in several ways - that is for you to decide.",
