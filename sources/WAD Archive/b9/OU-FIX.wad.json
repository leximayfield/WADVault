	"description": "The sprites & flats installation of Jean-Serge Gagnon's OTTAWAU.WAD - CHG2OU.BAT - requires registered DOOM v1.9 and won't install with Ultimate DOOM, leaving the sprites and flats graphics inaccessible, as they are contained within proprietary-format .PCH files. This fix changes the format of these extra items to something that is usable with both vanilla and source ports The fix fully complies with the Copyright/ Permissions section of OTTAWAU09.TXT: - it does NOT use OTTAWAU.WAD as a base to build additional levels - it does NOT distribute OTTAWAU.WAD, with or without modifications",
