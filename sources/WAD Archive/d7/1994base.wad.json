	"description": "This is the first map of a serious series. I want to make some tributes to all styles of mapping. I made this level according to 1994 canons such as low detail and only a weapon available (shotgun). In a secret cave I wrote the name of the best (in my humble opinion) wads made in 1994 that changed my lifestyle. The numbers in brackets are the \"id\" at /idgames.",
