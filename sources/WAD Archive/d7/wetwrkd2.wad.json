UAC recon indicates an enemy presence, the hell spawn have redecorated and HQ doesn't like the color scheme. No one really likes you much, so we've decided to send you in alone, poorly armed, with no fire- support what so ever. If you survive we'll swing by and pick you up sooner or later, otherwise we'll be drinking beer and pissing on your grave. Good Luck!!!",
