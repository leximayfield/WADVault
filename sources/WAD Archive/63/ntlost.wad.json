	"description": "Necromantic Thirst was originally started in 2007 under the name \"Nuked Area\". Back then, I intended to make detailed maps, on a regular basis, and episodic releases. As people joined the team, many of the ideas and goals I had fell under the picky requests and pointless feedbacks, only leading to make my original project, theirs. After years of nothing-ness and some communication problems among the team, thus leading me to destroy, out of frustration the project. Because of that, the wad only includes the new textures, and my maps, leaving the other free to release them later on.",
