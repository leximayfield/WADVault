	"description": "A lost city. Nice architecture, lot of mosnters, hard game, just a little puzzle. Is my level #16. STORY: The legend told about a city that adore the devil and it had the power to find as many gold as it wish. But a day the nerby tribes kill 'em all and built a wall sorrounding it so nobody can get near it's unholy god. Since then dozens of explorers (like you) searched for it and never return. Now is your turn. When you find it, you start to think that better than the gold, is to get out alive... Use the weapons the previus explorers left behaind and find an exit!",
