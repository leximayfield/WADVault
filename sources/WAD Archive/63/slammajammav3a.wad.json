	"description": "This is a skin that Zero and I made in about 4 hours of actual effort but it came out really well. The skin is of an imp dressed up in a basketball outfit bouncing a basketball when you move. Nightmare Zero did the sprites and I did the sounds and other junk. It has many taunts that were pulled from the announcer on NBA Jam. Really good for deathmatch. Feel free to include this in a skin pack, just give credit if you would please. ENJOY!",
