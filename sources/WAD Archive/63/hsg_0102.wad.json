	"description": "It's been a few years now since the monsters had invaded earth; and since then you have taken up residence at Earth's only remaining radio telescope facility, where you have found yourself scanning fervently for the sound of any other human voice. You bang your head on a hang- ing desk lamp with a start as the transceiver now crackles to life.. It's a transmission from the MTMM (Manned Teraforming Mars Mission), Which had launched towards Mars about four years ago. (And which was now humanities last desperate hope). We have no experience dealing with these things, they exclaim, It's a *@mn infestation.. With their current distance, and a constant 1G acceleration rate: They barely have just enough time and energy to teleport you, (and your DM squad), to what they call a secure area as they lock down the ship. My God, help us!! you hear them scream as the teleport pad hums to life, It's happening again, just like on Plutonia..",
