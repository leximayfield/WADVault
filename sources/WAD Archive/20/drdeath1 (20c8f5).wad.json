	"description": "Half-Baked Meaningless Babble: Ok folks, here it is, the long awaited (haha) DRDEATH1 patch wad for your killing pleasure. I enjoy DOOM wads with a space station motif, but I don't exactly enjoy running around trying to solve all kinds of puzzles. There are a few things to figure out in DRDEATH1 but nothing extreme. This is a level designed with killing in mind. Getting trapped in a little room with 4 barons of hell sucks, so you won't find anything harder to kill than a cacodemon. I prefer getting in shotgun fights with the sergeants and being overrun by the little bastards, so thats what I have created. Lots of former humans, sergeants, and imps with a few demons and cacodemons thrown in. I also indulge in two more of my favorite scenarios: big rooms and dodging fireballs. You'll see. This is a good size level with 500 something enemies so I recommend a pretty speedy 'puter.",
