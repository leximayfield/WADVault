	"description": "Pyrethrum is a small powerplant located on the firey satellite, Io. After various freak accidents during UAC's portal experiments, the plant was abandoned. Years later it was recommisioned for use, but it was found that the past portal experiments that took place there left most of the machinery unoperable. So UAC turned it into a training area for new space marine recruits. The plant's old mass waste compactor has been turned into a nifty deathtrap for those who try to get their hands on the BFG10K, making for some interesting training exercises.",
