	"description": "One day, you wake up to find yourself stranded in a strange demon temple in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't seem much different from other demonic temples you've seen, but in this one, time loses meaning and only oblivion reigns. You are trapped in this temple with no way out in sight, but as you inspect the area you notice switches all around - maybe they open a way out? But they're all heavily guarded by demons and possessed humans. Good luck Marine, you'll need it.",
