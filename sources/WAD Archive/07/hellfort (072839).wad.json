	"description": "This wad was first made for Doom but then DoomII came out. I got the wad changer which switches Doom wads into DoomII wads. Then I changed most things and textures. This is a 3 level episode designed for multiplayer (either DM or Cooperative). The end level has Bosses so be prepared.PLEASE E-MAIL ME ON IF YOU THINK IT IS A GOOD DEATHMATCH WAD",
