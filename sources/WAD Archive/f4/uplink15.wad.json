	"description": "Three maps taking place in a virtual reality infected by Hell. Made in January-February of 2015, these were inspired by various cyberpunk, vaporwave, and other, similar sci-fi music and artworks - in fact, it was intended to be the part of a bigger mapset that couldn't happen eventually. I wish I could tell anything else, but that's all: finished maps waiting in silence for almost two years. I hope you enjoy them after so much pause! Good luck! cc4-tex.wad fully included, with some textures replaced by own creations. Music: \"One Must Fall 2097 - Menu v1.1\" MIDI Maebashi Station - Chicago Skaven - Walk it off Deus Ex: Nihilum OST - Queens, ambient track",
