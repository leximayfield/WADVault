	"description": "A marble castle and the surrounding caves and mountains. The name comes from the music, \"The Call of Ktulu\" by Metallica. The music fits the mood of the level perfectly and I thought the name did, too. I think this is a pretty hard wad, but I spent a lot of time implementing the skill levels so hopefully everyone will find a level corresponding to his or her skills.",
