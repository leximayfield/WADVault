	"description": "All maps are: (i) medieval-themed, and generally very large compared to typical DooM maps; (ii) non-linear and feature multiple paths; (iii) feature castle and fortress architecture, fights on an epic scale, and magnificent vistas. Maps 08-10 can be played in any order within the hub, and powerups & enemies are different in any given map depending on whether you play it first or play it after entering from another map. This provides additional replay value. This is a 7-map demo. TeamTNT intends to create a full megawad next. Tested with ZDooM and GZDooM",
