	"description": "This wad is for Doom II. Just when you thought they outlawed public fighting events, you return home to find yourself entering the main event. You approach the squared circle, blood everywhere in the ring. A couple of poor saps impaled around the outside of the ring, and a few angry spectators watching from the stands. Beware not to upset your apponents, they will appear later in the ring for the Battle Royale. Make your way to the announcers booth and watch the show if you dare. And remember if you have to go to the restroom, there down the hall from where you entered the building. The bathrooms are labeled. If you get hungry check out the snack bar around the corner.",
