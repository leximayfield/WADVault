	"description": "This was going to be one of those abondoned run down buildings in the middle of nowhere scenarios...but I decided not to do that. This level plays well as a small and challenging single player level and wonderful as a DeathMatch Level with sniper points and the like. It's still a building in the middle of nowhere but...lets just say it's owners still live there and enjoy sacrificing to their Gods.",
