I only use doom builder, XWE and Slumped I get inspiration with dooms wad like scythe, alien vendetta, scythe 2, doom plutonia, the olds dooms (i dont copy anything, only i used the music for many few levels). The story is inspired in the Saint Seiya anime serie. Have 32 new levels. I did it alone, I have the nostalgic of the doom in the old times, so I want to make it at that way, the easy way I think.",
