	"description": "Halloween is just around the corner and so are the Sargents, Troopers, Imps, Demons, Cacodemons, Lost Souls and Barons. There are definately more tricks than treats in this all new made from scratch level. There is new music, the theme from Halloween, all weapons, lots of lifts, a bunch of doors and stairs all over the place. The level is quite large and will require using your wits as well as your weapons. There are a lot of hidden triplines that will open up new sectors (at sometimes very inconvienient times) and release even more trick or treaters.",
