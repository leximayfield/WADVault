	"description": "Two levels of Deathmatch fun for DOOM2! Level 2 has been replaced with a mega-fragger level in a giant open area! You'll frag for hours in here and love every minute of it. Giant circle arena with 1 teleport and 1 exit (But where is it??) Level 3 APPEARS to be the same as ever!?! NO! There are a bunch of new secrets! Ah, to find them... Don't believe everything you see! A classic frag-on level is now revitalized with sneaky new rooms and tr.. No, you'll see! :> Level 1 has not been changed due to its great design, so start from 1 and see if you can (or if you even ever WANT to) get through my 2 levels beyond!",
