	"description": "The catacombs were built by the Romans for their dead. This is a large, intricate and polished level with ornate architecture with lots of special graphics and sounds. In particular the imps have been replaced by mummies. It has a very gloomy and haunted atmosphere and you will be glad to get out at the end. It is an expert's level, with some very violent, but never impossible, fights. See below for more description.",
