	"description": "Takes place in an old castle. The best part about this wad is that no matter where you start, you have a chance. So after your buddy whoops you you can come right back and whoop him. There are no places to hide and stock up on ammo and stuff so don't bother to look for a safe spot. This wad keeps the Action going. There is even a stream and a beautifull 2000 foot waterfall.",
