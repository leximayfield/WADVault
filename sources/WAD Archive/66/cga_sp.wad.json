	"description": "A very violent single-player version of Chaingun Arena. Not for the faint-hearted. Mainly designed with UV Speed in mind. I haven't tested whether UV Max is possible, but I'm pretty sure there is enough ammo, given the enormous scope for infighting. Differences from the DM version: monsters, weapons, ammo and power-ups added. Red key now needed to exit; some barrels added; one sector given strobe lighting and a damaging floor; some lines changed to \"monsters can't cross\"; one sector made into a secret (though it's not very well hidden); some rock pillars enlarged so that monsters can be put on them.",
