	"description": "My first HeXen level. This level's concept will probably be incorperated into one of the levels in my other current DOOM ][ project (as yet unnamed). This is the first time I've designed a level with both Single Player and Co-op / Deathmatch in mind, and I think that it will be pretty good for all types of play. There are alot of bad guys tho' so it would be a good idea to use -nomonsters on Deathmatch. I haven't polished it as much as I'd like to. If I get some feedback (hint), then I'll probably align those textures and fix the glitter bridge. I might also add difficulty settings if asked nicely. I might re-release this wad with a nice demo in it as well *:)",
