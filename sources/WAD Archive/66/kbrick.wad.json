	"description": "This one turned out different than I intended. The scenery is better than the fights. I tried to compensate, but I think some areas are too big for my style, and I can't fill in the gaps between fights. Some spots have very high monster counts. I just wanted to do something different from what my other WADS look like. Please send me comments, good or bad.",
