	"description": "I love to play converted levels to Doom2, and I used to challenge a lot of other people to put Quake maps into Doom. some of the results of this include DM3.wad (by mystican) and dm4.wad (not yet released by Brv-Zokum). Since no one created a base1 conver sion from quake2, myst challenged me to create it. So, i decided to take a crack at it. After being introduced to the great EdMap level editor, I started building furiously at this map for 2 months straight Near the end i started to slack off because Deathmatch on this map was tooooo fun. Thanks Dvs and knort. ;) The main goal of this map is Deathmatch, altho SP is fun if you try to speed-run. Current top time belongs to Adam Hegyi, or Hegyi Adam, (i dunno, his irc nick is Adam_H), with 0:08. If anyone can top that, mail it to me. if anyone is interested in creating base2.wad or base3.wad (off of quake2), please mail me. However, i will have no part in a conversion that uses q2 textures. Doom2 has fine textures. Btw, anyone got the q2 tracks on midi? =)",
