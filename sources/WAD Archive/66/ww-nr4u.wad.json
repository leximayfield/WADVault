	"description": "My first attempt at a map, using a few Boom features and a few experiments in detailing. Gameplay is simple mow-em-down, I suppose you could call it a slaughter map because I don't throw a lot of big monsters at you. And, true to my word, there is NO rocket launcher in this map. Not that you'll need one.",
