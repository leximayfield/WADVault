	"description": "Abstract techbase map with a space sky and a cyberdemon. Designed for the original Doom, and respecting the origi- nal limits -Visplane Overflows, etc-; I know, there is no point in this today, but it was a fun challenge trying to build a pretty scenery while avoiding those limits. I've spent a lot of time refining the gameplay. I Hope it pays and you find the map enjoyable and interesting. Features: * Non-linear. * Two different ways to kill the cyberdemon. * Singleplayer, cooperative and deathmatch. * A 1024x128 space sky with stars and planets. * An exit, and no illusio-pit (sorry!).",
