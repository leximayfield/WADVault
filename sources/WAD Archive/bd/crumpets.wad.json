	"description": "Crumpets is a set of 9 bite-size boom-compatible maps, designed to be played from pistol start. The levels are small, typically 50-100 monsters a piece, and loosely follow a plutonia / marble-ruins aesthetic. UV is designed for experts, so I encourage most players to start off on HMP.",
