	"description": "I have done 18 levels before these. Some of them were intended to be included here but those got destroyed so I had to start all over. Wad has new music, sounds and some graphics. Also a story about it, cool idea to print it and read it as you play. Also it's wise to save at least in start of each level, since some levels have no- escape death traps and puzzles that wrongly done will get you stuck later on the level. NOTICE: play deathmatch only with medium or easy skill, and coop only with hard or nightmare skill. Otherways DM will be too boring or coop way too easy.",
