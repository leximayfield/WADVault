	"description": "These files will (hopefully) serve as a replacement for the earlier version of Tele-Direct Atlantic Doom I uploaded to this site previously. TELLY.WAD Replaces MAP01 of Doom2 with a layout of my employer's office. I have improved the appearance of the computer workstations (They now look much more realistic) I've also replaced the Imps with a sprite-animation sequence of Telly, our company mascot. TD2.WAD, TD4.WAD, TD6.WAD Used to customize layout so it resembles office.",
