	"description": "The third level in the UNX series. This level continues from where \"UNX02: Underground\" ends. Designed for vanilla Doom but should work with any common source port. Story: You finally arrive to a familiar place, only to find the gibs of the secretary you had a crush on. Dark thoughts plague your mind (could it be demonic influence?): \"She always ignored me anyways. Fuck it, she deserved it.\" But you quickly remember you have a task at hand... \"Man, what the hell is wrong with me? No time for bullshit. It's time to kill!\" Additional features: -One part of this map is a little tribute to \"The Gantlet\" (MAP03 of Doom II). -There's a fun \"easter egg\" in the automap. Don't miss it! :)",
