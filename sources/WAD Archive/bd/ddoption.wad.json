Gameplay should be relatively easy for the most part but some traps might catch you off guard, ammo/health balance turned out better than I expected especially map01, and for the people who were hoping for an map03 I will have to dissapoint them it never gotten that far at first they weren't ment to be released I was just trying some new ideas I had in my head.",
