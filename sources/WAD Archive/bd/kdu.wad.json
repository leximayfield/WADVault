	"description": "Designed to recreate the feel of Knee Deep in the Dead (episode 1 of the Ultimate Doom), levels are relativley short and simple but at the same time still look and feel good, gameplay is basic but hopefully fun and entertaining. Each level is doable from a pistol start although it is recommended that you play it through as a whole episode.",
