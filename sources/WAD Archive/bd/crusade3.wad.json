	"description": "Lot's of rooms and passageways -but take it easy,First Aid Stations are few and far between. The third in the \"Crusader Trilogy\" (the other two parts are around somewhere). The inspiration came from the many Crusader castles I've visited in Israel..Bel Voir in the Jordan Valley,Kaalat Nimrod in the Golan Heights,but mostly the underground Crusader city in Akko. These guys were amazing,they knew how to make wads--real ,lifesize wads--they were the original Doomers and all of 900 years ago.",
