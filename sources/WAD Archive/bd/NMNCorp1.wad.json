	"description": "No levels this time. What You have here is a full fledged ready to go texture set made by myself, fully. No fooling around such as combining Doom textures to make something new, nope, what You have here is 100% Brand Fresh from Scratch. The texture set was originally inspired by Quake 2 - a game that I missed while I've lost it. I've downloaded the Quake 2 Texture Wad (Props to Derek Mac Donald aka Afterglow) looked at all the beauty, got some ideas and started creating my own ones from scratch. In the latter time I've got my Quake 2 back on my comp, and after blasting some Stroggos I've decided.. that the set needs more textures :) I've also got some other inspiration and it all formed a very pleasent, dark, futuristic, desolated collection of graphics. I was going to build a level with them, but I've lost interest. Those were made in July when my project was paused, so in freetime I didn't fool around-I practiced :] Enjoy!",
