	"description": "As you stride down to the burning city of Hell On Earth you note a baron reading a sign. The baron appears rather annoyed at the weathered sign reading \"Under Construction - please come back in October.\" The baron gives one final scream and heads for a rock outcropping. You follow - and find yourself teleported along with the baron back to his queen's layer (nix your armor and all weapons but your pistol)!",
