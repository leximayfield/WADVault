	"description": "3 episode wad for ultimate doom with the usual tech/hell tech/hell setup with a few exceptions from time to time. This is an expansion from my cbspeed.wad I realeased last August, so the first episode is an updated version of cbspeed with hopefully improved gameplay and layout flow. Episodes 2 and 3 were solely built from scratch. The wad is designed to hopefully give a varied and at times challenging gameplay experience.",
