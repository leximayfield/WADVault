	"description": "Freaky Panties is an experimental level that adjusts itself to how well you play. If you're playing well, it will get a bit harder. If you start to die too often, it will scale back the difficulty automatically. Essentially I tried to make the map adjust itself without ever having to set a monster or item to only appear on certain difficulty settings.",
