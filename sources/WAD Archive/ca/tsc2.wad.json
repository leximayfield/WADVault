	"description": "This wad takes place in a cave by the aliens. You have been told by Earth officials that they have located a patch of alien resistance in a huge cave which used to be a volcano and that the aliens have a top secret base inside the cave. You will be teleported inside the base, once inside you have been ordered to infiltrate the area and eliminate all the spawn you can, and hopefully finding and rescuing most of Marine hostages. If you can't, you have been ordered to terminate them. Earth officals warn you that some of the humans sided with the aliens during their takeover, and there MIGHT still be some around.",
