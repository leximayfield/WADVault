	"description": "This is an awesome Deathmatch level consisting of one fairly large \"arena\" with two attached stair cases and a duel room that you can get to via teleport. This level is pretty cool I think, especially considering it is only the second level I ever created so far (the other bit the dust). I hope you all like it. Send suggestions and such to me at the above address. I will try to respond if you want me to. Thanks for trying this level.",
