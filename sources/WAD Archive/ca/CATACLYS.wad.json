	"description": "This wad is one of the best 4 player deathmatch playing fields ever constructed. It was designed with 4 player games in mind but 2 player games also proved to be fun and challenging. Innovative in design allowing fun, action packed play no matter what your style of playing is. Campers, Stalkers, Snipers, and all out Bloodthirsty frag maniacs all have a place in this wad. The design was inspired by bits and pieces of all my favorite deathmatch wads mixed with ideas of my own. This wad takes strategy as well as dueling skill. The design of this wad also makes for some funny kills. There are new sounds in this wad! MUSIC BY METALLICA!! Basically, this wad rocks!",
