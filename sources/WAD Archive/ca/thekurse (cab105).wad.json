	"description": "I have made a lot of quicky deathmatch and co-op levels. This is my first single- player level. I worked a LONG time on this level, and it's pretty big. It consists of 4 main areas. The first is the entance hall, the second is to get the keycard to get to the 3rd and so forth. I didn't implement skill levels, but it CAN be ended alone on Ultra- Violence, I have tested it, as well as some of my doom buddies. I added in extra monsters and weapons for multiplayer <cyber-demon>. I suggest you play with no monsters when playing death- match. I also put in many secret area's, so try and find those. This is my first \"professional\" level, so I'd appreciate any comments about what you think of it.",
