	"description": "An updated version of toxin666, changed several things to make gamplay run smoother(hopefully) Made this level suited for skill levels, since the original had only one (call me lazy for that) -Skill 1/2 Boring as hell my granny can beat it with her eyes closed, shotgun availible in start room. You face an total of 42 monsters and mostly troopers, good skill level for checking things out. -Skill 3 Pretty tough at start since there isn't an shotgun in the start room, but still rather easy. You will have to shoot your way trough 98 monsters and more sergeants and imps roam this map. -Skill 4/5 Pretty hard at the start I could make it past the first door without being hit (lucky) Try to get an shotgun as soon as possible before the two demons teleport to your location. You will face an total of 202 monsters and dummy sectors are filled with monsters this time. Best suited for the more skilled player, I suggest starting on an lower skill level first.",
