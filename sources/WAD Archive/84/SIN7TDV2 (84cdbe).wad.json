	"description": "This is a combination of SinSeven.wad and tdevil2.wad, however it contains several bugfixes and improvements over both. This runs in any vanilla limit-removing compatible port, but is optimized in zdoom with a mapinfo lump. Difficult setting are implemented, so if it's too hard just turn it down a notch. Enjoy!",
