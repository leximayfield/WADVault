	"description": "Ohh happy days, when you destroyed the gate- keeper and saved Earth once again. Another hellish monster saw its maker. You were once again the hero and received another bundle of medals. But. Some distant and very secret UAC areas had also been hit by the terrible army of monsters. Especially the processing area of the special water made to keep the gates cool and operative. This area has been taken over by the freaks from hellcity and needs to be cleared. Some squadrons sent in to retrieve the base has already been wasted and now UAC needs there best man: You. You will be teleported into one of four secret small elevators all disguised as a high metal and brik processing machine (according to earlier mission reports, the monsters has not yet figured out that it has no real function, which will be our advantage) situated high in the middle of the complex. You will some places encounter friends hanged, killed or integrated as a part of their flamestick hell alters, but let it not distract your sences. Good luck and may God have mercy on your soul.",
