	"description": "This was originally designed as a part of the Second Heretic Speedmapping session, but after I finished the map I realised they demanded Deathmatch-maps, so this map did not fit into the project. Years later, I found it on my harddrive again and after playing it I thought it was not that bad and worth a release. Of course it is a speedmap and a just a very small level, but I think it is still fun. But just try it ;) A Mapinfo file is included, other than that, the Map does not use any ZDoom features. I recommend playing this with GZDoom, the fog effect just looks cooler then.",
