	"description": "I made this wad file right after I discovered DEU, the almighty doom level editor. This is an experi- mental level for me. I made it as I was learning DEU and its how to. This is why there is no general theme to this wad ( Hence the name confusion). I will make my future pwad files with a general theme in mind. I would hope that you enjoy this level. I would also greatly appreciative if you could drop me a line and let me know what you thought of this wad (Good or Bad). If there were any concept, rooms and or ideas you liked or disliked.",
