	"description": "A 5-level WAD for Doom II. After strolling through hellish catcombs, you emerge in a greenish pasture. A large fortress lies in front of you. Taking a few steps, you realize you're not alone, and bars descend from the ceiling blocking your way back. The only way out is through. Good luck! --- NOTE: The wad is designed for single player, although it supports cooperative and deathmatch. Recommended difficulty: Ultra-Violence!",
