	"description": "MAP30--Dark, evil base with a little hell theme thrown in. It's the kind of level I love to play. The music of MAP30 goes great with it.(EXCEPT WITH BOOM) My first completed pwad. This is a revised version that I have cleaned up a little. Thanks to Rich Sham for the feedback. Some secrets are pretty hard to find. Watch the demo to find them all.(now included)",
