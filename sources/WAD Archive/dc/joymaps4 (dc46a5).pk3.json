	"description": "This was a communal mapping session that took place between the 1st and the 10th of July, 2017. The participants mapped under the strict guidance of Jimmy and a few session tutors via Discord and TwitchTV and were talked through the basics of mapping, such as creating connected areas, interesting layouts, and using thing placement sensibly. The participants mapped in a variety of formats, mostly Boom and ZDoom (UDMF).",
