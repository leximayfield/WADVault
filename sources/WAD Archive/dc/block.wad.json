	"description": "This deathmatch level turned out really well: it has got to be one of the fastest levels ever. Anti-hording methods have been employed: such as over-abundance of weapons. All four big dm weapons are used: chain gun, double barrel, rocket launcher and plasma gun, and set up so that a good player should almost be able to take out any weapon with any other. This is purely an action level. Strategy is a second concern. The type of game I'm interested in here is the breakneck, no holds barred frags fests. There is no health what so ever - which just adds to the speed and action. It's a small level, so I don't think more than 2 players will be able to fit in here.",
