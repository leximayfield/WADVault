	"description": "This is a compilation of the WADs entered in SargeBaldy's third speedmapping exercise. Participants were given 100 minutes to create a Doom 2 level on a certain theme. This week's theme was to make a map based off this scenario: \"The Doom Marine stands on a dirt path which stops abruptly near a menacing castle. Within that castle there is the keep in which lives Queen Hissy, last of the cacodemons, the very same who ordered the slaughter of your pet rabbit, Daisy. You must find a way to get into the keep and kill Hissy no matter what the danger. This time, it's personal.\"",
