	"description": "This is my first attempt at a 'Doom the way Id Did'-like map. It is based mainly on the style of Tom Hall's Doom maps, namely E1M4, E2M1, E2M2, E2M3, E2M4, E2M7, E3M3, E3M7, and MAP 10. Perhaps more of a medley/remix than a raw style replication, I feel it's a decent map, nonetheless. I wasn't arsed to build for vanilla limits, so you'll very likely need a limit removing port to run this. Enjoy!",
