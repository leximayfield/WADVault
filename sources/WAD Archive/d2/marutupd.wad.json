	"description": "Maruta 731 for doom. Eliminate the Japanese army and witness the horror at Unit 731. This mod was loosely based on true events involving Unit 731, and is extremely graphic. It is a combination of Doom and Wolfenstein in style. It was first released during its early stages and was given bad reviews so I added a lot to this. If you don't like it this time, you can suck it. NO MORE UPDATES ! PART II IN 2013! I broke away from trying to base it on the real buildings and made it more \"Doom-like\" instead. Keep on your toes. Many secrets and traps. FEATURES: -8 WEAPONS- BONESAW , KNIFE , PISTOL , SHOTGUN , MACHINEGUN , GRENADE AND MINE -3 ENEMIES- GUARD , COMMANDO AND SCIENTIST -FREEABLE PRISONERS -SECRET UNIT 731 MAPS (NOT LEVELS) -EXPLODEABLE CORPSES , PROJECTILE , WALLS AND EQUIPMENT -8 MAPS (UPDATED AND EXTENDED) -NEW MENU , TEXT , SCREENS , WALLS , FLOORS , CEILINGS , SPRITES , MUSIC AND SOUNDS -IMPROVED SPRITES AND TEXTURES -MORE BLOOD AND GORE (credit to nashgore) -FASTER ENEMIES AND GUNS",
