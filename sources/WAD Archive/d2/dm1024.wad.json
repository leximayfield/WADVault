	"description": "I wanted to contribute this map to second round of Congestion 1024, but after it was stopped, I stopped with making this map too. After some time I decided to finish it. At the end I broke the 1024x1024 concept a little, but still it is small map. It is quite hard (from first seconds) and quite cramped. I hope that u will like it though.",
