	"description": "This is a file made originally for Doom. I converted to Doom II and made use of Doom II's texteures, monsters, etc. It also Includes a fourth level that is not on the original, plus an extra secret room in the third level. The game was originally meant to be a replacement for the 2nd episode of Doom and was titled \"Massacre on Deimos.\" I tweaked the original Doom story line a little by saying that the infestation was a gradual one (got worse with each area) and several scientists died in the attack. A small handfull lived to tell you the story, and about the seeming \"Stairway to hell\" going down to their former rec room.",
