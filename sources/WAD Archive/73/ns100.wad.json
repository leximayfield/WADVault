	"description": "This map was thrown together to celebrate the 100th week of Newstuff at DoomWorld! Yes, the design is quite linear, but it was easier to make those huge letters that way. what do you want? should I have made the areas like a circle or something? And don't complain about the BFG, if you don't want to use it, dont freaking use it. also, the BFG is only there in skill level 1 and 2 anyways.",
