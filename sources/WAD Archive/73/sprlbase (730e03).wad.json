	"description": "This started as a small, simple techbase to test my understanding of basic mapping techniques while making something decent and playable, but I kept adding to it as I thought of more ideas and styles I wanted to try (hence the name). Skilled players will definitely find this one on the easy side, especially at the beginning, but I did try to create some moments of challenge. I won't do too much apologizing here--suffice it to say there are a LOT of things I would do differently next time around. This map was designed without the use of mouselook, jumping, or crouching, but I don't think you'll break anything too badly by using any of that. There's a room near the end where you'll have to noclip back if you hop over the railings, but that's about it.",
