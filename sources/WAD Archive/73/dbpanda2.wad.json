	"description": "This was my submission to an E3 project Hellbent started where we'd try to duplicate the look and play style of E3M3: Pandemonium without paying homage to the original. The project never received many submissions and I decided to release this as stand alone after nearly a year of inactivity. This map, like the original, was initially designed as a Tom Hall style techbase. The original E3M3 looks like it was literally in the middle of being retextured when Doom was released, so I tried to keep that same feel in this map. I think mine's a bit more hellish looking than the original.",
