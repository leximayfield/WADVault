	"description": "Hello again fellow Doomers. Here I have 15 more deathmatch maps for you all to enjoy, as usual! I think people who are familiar with my deathmatch stuff will find these to be above my previous par - I spent more time than usual working on tactical layouts and clean visuals, while keeping the maps fairly simple/accessable to any player of any skill level. Some of these are remakes of older maps of mine, but revamped for a deathmatch. If you're familiar with them you'll have an advantage when you play online. Each map is full of secrets so wall humping anything that may look out of place is always a good idea. Map10 has a -ton- of secret areas and walls that can be walked through, and the layout of the map changes a lot if all the switches are found, turning it from a tactical map with hiding spots into a totally level playing feild. I hope you all enjoy these, I had a lot of fun making them and testing them with other doomers!",
