	"description": "Mayan666 is based on the architecture of the ancient Mayan civilization. There is a large open area containing four buildings, three of which are pyramids. In the center is a sunken court where a kind of soccer to the death was once played. There are also three small underground areas off the large open area. See hint at the end of this file if you can't find the rocket launcher.",
