	"description": "This is a built from scratch level. It was created using DoomCAD 4.3 by Matt Tagliaferri. This is my first serious attempt. I appreciate any comments or feedback (good or bad) that you may have. It's not a huge file so it should run well on most all machines. There may be a few bugs here and there, but I think you will find it interesting.",
