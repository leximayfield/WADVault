	"description": "This is an accumulation of deathmatch levels I have made. There is no set theme. Some are parts of coop levels in progress, some are just spaces I created for the purpose. A Duel - Duel map shaped like an A with a bridge. X Duel - X shaped duel map.. Octagon Duel - Octagon shaped duel map (imaginative, huh!) Pentagram Deathmatch - A Deathmatch map with a sequence of six switches, which unlock a two switch combination, giving access to larger guns and more play area. Tank Deathmatch - A small base with two tanks in a large room. In one tank is a rocket launcher, the other, a plasma gun. Using the computers in the rooms will drain the tanks, trapping anyone caught inside for 30 seconds.. I will add more maps if/when I make them..",
