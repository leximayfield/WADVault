	"description": "This wad was designed solely for DEATHMATCH. No bloodbath arenas here! If you like a wad with a lot of ambush points and stalking positions, this is the one for you (I enjoy it, anyway). I've never played this Wad in a 3 or 4 person DEATHMATCH, so if you do, I'd like to hear how it fared. I'd also be interested in seeing any LMP's made in this Wad. I'd also be interested in hearing any comments of what you thought (This is my first Wad, so please be merciful!).",
