	"description": "You are air-dropped into a demon breeding factory somewhere in Peru. The place is crawling with aliens and mutants. Your mission is Search and Destroy. Wipe out the base entirely. A reliable security scan of the area, performed by UAC PsiOps, has all but confirmed the presence of a Spider Mastermind somewhere in the complex. Other powerful targets were detected as well.
