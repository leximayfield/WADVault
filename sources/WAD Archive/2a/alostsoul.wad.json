	"description": "Somehow for some weird reason you find yourself in the main hall of what seems to be a demonic castle, or temple, that doesn't really matter. What matters is that you have to find a way out of there, fast, or you'll end up like that dead marine before you... This is a somewhat small and pretty challenging map, created as a kind of a tribute to my favourite doom monster. Jumping is NOT supposed to be used in this map.",
