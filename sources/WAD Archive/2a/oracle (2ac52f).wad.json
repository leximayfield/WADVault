	"description": "A large alien base has been discovered by a Scout and Survey team in the Regulus Cluster on a close Terran analogue. Sensor readings show possible traces of a highly advanced technology. You've been assigned the job of exploration. Relax! Fleet Intel reports that it's 99.999% likely that the base is unoccupied and probably friendly (yeah,right!). You won't be allowed to carry any weapons in but your pistol... as usual.",
