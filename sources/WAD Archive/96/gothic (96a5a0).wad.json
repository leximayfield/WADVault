	"description": "I have tried to make a hellish and very \"dark\" level this time. I have mostly used the more gothic and obscure textures this time in order to achieve that hostile and evil environment. I originally wanted my Avind.wad to look like this level, however my expertise in level designing did not allow me this opportunity. So, as a goodbye to level desig- ning I have chosen to make a level much like the one I started out with as a sort of tribute. I personally feel that this level is one of the best.",
