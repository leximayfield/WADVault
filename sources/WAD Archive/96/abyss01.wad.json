	"description": "\"Into the Abyss\" is my first attempt with lighting and is also an intro for a new episode I will work on. I put far more detail and work into it than I did with \"Dead Zone,\" and retained some simplicity. I tired to create the classic doom experience, once again. Have fun. I will add multilayer start locations/guns, difficulty settings, and more secrets on a later date.",
