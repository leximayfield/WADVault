	"description": "The Story: The Hell-spawn are a little POed with you. First you defeated them on Mars' moons and in Hell in DOOM, stopped their invasion of Earth in DOOM2, and destroyed their gates in The Final DOOM. Now they've taken revenge. They killed your family and your girl friend. You're filled with rage. You want to kill every last one of these bastards. But now they're ready for you... and more than happy to let you try. The Ultimate Battles is an eight level DOOM WAD made for good DOOM palyers, the kind that don't panic at hellish demonic onslaughts. Read about the levels below, then frag away, little marine.",
