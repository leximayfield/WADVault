	"description": "After the portal to the Chaos Realm was opened, the evil forces of Korax began pouring through, spreading terror, pain, and destruction throughout the world. Those who weren't killed outright were turned into monsters for the evil army, or just for some power's amusement. They have built a temple around the portal, which continues to spew out new horrors every day. This fountain of Chaos is the heart of the evil power on this world- and also its greatest weakness! Now the few survivors who have not joined with Korax have discovered that many of the powerful objects used by the evil army are erupting from the same Chaos Fountain that the monsters themselves are. You are the last survivor(s) of the group sent to steal some of these items for humanity. It is hoped that, if you survive in the heart of Chaos long enough, you will be powerful enough to wipe the plague of darkness from the world, maybe even track Korax back to his lair and vanquish him. Good luck - because luck is all you have.",
