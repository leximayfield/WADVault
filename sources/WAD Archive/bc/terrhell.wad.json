	"description": "UPDATED: hard maps. each map can be considered a game of its own. lots of ACS scripting! it's just a crap map set with a very linear and randomized layout which is not as meaningful regarding pertinence to the saga of the game, but does have a lot of obstacles, traps and puzzles. (uploaded after being banned from being uploaded for unorthodox gameplay.) saving only works in GZDoom and other more advanced ports.",
