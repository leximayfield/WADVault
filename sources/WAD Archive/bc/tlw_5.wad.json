	"description": "As with previous Lost WADs, I built this with attention to texture alignment and playability using ALL the keys. It is a bit smaller than previous work, but if you notice how well the game plays (tested at all levels) you'll copy this one to your floppy disc. NOTE: I added an \"Easter Egg\" to this one as an incentive to play on. If you find it, e-mail me and tell me how you like it! You'll never see things the same way again!",
