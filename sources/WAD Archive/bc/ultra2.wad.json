	"description": "My friend and I are always playing Death Match, and he is always whinning(and losing) about how one person can get the weapons and control the game. SO, I have made this one to be completly fair, everyone starts in a spot with ammo and weapons, and no other weapons (i.e. BFG, Rocket Launcher..etc.)are available. Also, I have added a nice little twist that makes it even more fair, ah, but I'm not going to tell you about that. You should notice towards the end of the game!!",
