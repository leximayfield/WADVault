	"description": "This is my best level so far. It turned out pretty nicely, I think. I wanted it to resemble a large gothic cathedral, and it sort of does (nice, huh?). I intend to make an entire episode based on this theme, this being the first level of the episode. I just wanted to get this one out, and let people play it, so I could get some feedback. I really would like to know what you people think of this level! Please? NOTE: If you are using anything less than DOOM version 1.666, then you will experience some very, VERY nasty HOM. Please be advised.",
