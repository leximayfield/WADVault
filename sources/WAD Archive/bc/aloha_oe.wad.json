	"description": "It begins with a step into blood\u2026 and 3 ancient demons, watching and waiting... waiting for a taste of your blood. They could take you by force and beat you and break you and drain you dry. And they may. But the blood, they know, is much sweeter, more powerful, if given freely. And so the game begins. Survival. Not just of your body. But of your mind. But that\u2019s what you do, right? You survive. And you kill. You kill. And you survive. Once again you find yourself in a DoomWorld nightmare. So you strap up, man up, and lock and load. Remember\u2026 there is no dishonor in death. Only in defeat.",
