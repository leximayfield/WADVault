	"description": "This is a wad that has 8 levels. This is the bridge to Xornox's world. It consists of mostly bosses. They are regular doom2 enemies made into hard bosses. I say that from level 4 and up the bosses become harder. The 4th boss is the hardest boss to beat I think. Lv's 1-7 are the bosses Lv 8 is the enterance to the Fire Palace.",
