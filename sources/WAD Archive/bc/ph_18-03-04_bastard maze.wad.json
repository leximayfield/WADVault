	"description": "A map themed around use of self-referencing sectors, made for the Valentines' Day ASS34 (featured as MAP19). As is often the way in these projects, the whole thing is deliberately mean and tongue-in-cheek... Therefore, the map lives up to it's name. Was actually inspired by a WAD featured in Hank Leukart's Hackers' Guide to Doom, which did a saner version of the invisible wall maze with colour-coded flooring.",
