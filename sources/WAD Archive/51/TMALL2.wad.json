	"description": "A 4 level episode in a mall. Unlike CPHOBOS, all of the secrets here have better hints to their existance. This episode has extensive new graphics and is built to look just like a mall with a new monster. Uses DeHackEd for new effects such as shooting computers and windows, the new monster and new text. For you deathmatch players, I have put in a button on level 3 that will take you back to level 2. This is a 2 level infinite cycle in the Doom version, but does not work for Doom2, just goes to level 2 then on to the last.",
