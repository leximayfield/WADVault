You still hadn't\r\nreached the place where the demons were coming from. The steel door shuts\r\nbehind you as you realize you're there; you're at the Phobos Anomaly. Cracks from\r\nhell are all over the place as seepage from the portal invades the entire installation.\r\nNow it's time to find the portal and stop the demons from coming through.
