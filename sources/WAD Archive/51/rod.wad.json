	"description": "A collection of story-driven relatively short maps based on some rather old ideas of mine which I've finally managed to realise in more or less adequate way. These maps are a bit harsh, but hopefully still provide some not-so-common visuals and deep atmosphere, as well as fast-paced and at times rather furious - but in general moderately difficult - gameplay. Technically there are 7 maps with 6 playable and 1 tiny outro map to prevent player from moving further into Doom 2 maps. IMPORTANT - cc4-tex.wad is required to play. There's also some .OGG music tracks so port with .OGG support is recommended - though not necessary - to play this .wad the way it's intended to be played. Changes in updated version: - tweaked Map03 since gameplay was too unpolished in original version; - fixed linedef 4812 in Map06 which seemed to have missing 'impassible' flag.",
