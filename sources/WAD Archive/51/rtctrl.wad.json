	"description": "A set of 4 maps using Quake textures. The maps are small to medium in size, and gameplay gradually gets harder as you progress. The maps are pretty detailed and have a good amount of interesting architecture. My goal was to make small-ish maps with gameplay that wasn't going to get brutally hard. At first I wasn't expecting to do more than one or two maps with these textures, but I had enough ideas and motivation to sqeeze out a few more maps. And it turned out to be a nice enough set of maps. I'm not planning to make more maps with these textures, but I might do a sequel with Quake 2 textures in the future.",
