	"description": "This is a replacement for E1M8, and boy is it tough! It's a fairly simple map, but is chock full of monsters. Lots of monsters. More monsters than a body should ever have to kill. This map was originally part of a full DOOM1 Episode, but not all the maps worked out very well so I scrapped the project and am releasing the maps that did work. Enjoy!",
