	"description": "\"Here it FINALLY is! The EXCITING (citation needed) CONCLUSION (please god) to the CRITICALLY PANNED WOOO series! In this EXCITING (citation needed) installment you will be forced into MULTIPLE MAPS on a quest to AVENGE A CLAYMATION demon guy (or some shit) with FULLY VOICED FMV CUTSCENES and STUNNING VISUALS that PUSH THE ENGINE TO ITS LIMIT (and you) as the GRIPPING STORY continues. Only YOU can save SOMEBODY by doing SOMETHING, I'm sure of it!\" WOOO 3 is... Well, tries to be, a jokewad made by many people simply for the sake of making things awful. Now this wasn't my original intention, but fuck my boring rules, who needs em? Anyway, this is for Doom 2 and the latest version of GZDoom (possibly Zandronum compatible as well?) and makes heavy use of GZDoom features so prepare your old hardware for a viking funeral.",
