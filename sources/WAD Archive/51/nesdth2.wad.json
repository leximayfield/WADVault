	"description": "Another 7 levels of pure deathmatchness by your SSG-wielding warrior, Nestea. This time, all the music are provided by LurkerHunter (yea, it's all original). Also new is a MAPINFO lump... which means that ZDOOM (and anything built off of it) players will get the cool rotating skies and such. Sorry, but none of the maps feature any ZDOOM-related things (which is good for those who play Legacy/JDOOM/etc.). Wait till NesDeath III for that! ;)",
