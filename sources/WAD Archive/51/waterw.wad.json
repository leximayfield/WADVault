This would be less of an issue if this wasn't in a strategic location that would assist greatly in the liberation of planet Reaver from the demonic horde. But, you know, it IS a strategic location and we bloody need it! Get this place under control damn it!\" This is another one of my random (somewhat related to each other) TNT maps I make for PrBoom, this one occupies the MAP16 slot. It involves tight corridor fighting (as per usual) and is par the course so far. Enjoy (?)",
