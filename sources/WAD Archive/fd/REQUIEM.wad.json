	"description": "This map is a taste of what Final Doom is all about - unleashing the potential of the DooM2 engine. The level incorporates a unique use for the Archvile ghost making technique, where it can resurrect a demon giving him the ability to walk through walls and not be shot. The first known way to kill such an enemy is to hit him in a rocket explosion. Another way is to get the ghost to hit another enemy who has a close attack ability, who will then go and tear the ghost apart. +----------------------------------------------------------------+ + Mission 24 + --------------",
