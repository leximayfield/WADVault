	"description": "The sounds in these WAD have been selected on various grounds. One of the important ones is that you don't get bored by a sample (since you'll be hearing it zillions of times!!). The samples do not match some kind of theme (for instance like the Aliens sound-wad), but we still like it 8^) This WAD works with all Doom 1.x versions.",
