	"description": "DEATHMATCH, 2 to 4 players. - Easy to identify exit. Two highth levels to fight on simultaneously, (frag fest!). Very loosely, based on the original Phobos Anomly; but highly improved with many, many, extras!. All weapons with lots of ammo are available, depending on skill lvel selected. Many secret rooms, teleporters, hidden pannels, drop down floor, invisible walls (the hidden panels and switches -Do Not Have- mis-aligned textures, and are difficult to find by design... :)",
