	"name": "BREEZE, BRAVADO & a revised 1.2 vs. of BRAVE",
	"description": "All 3 levels are extremely big - (Breeze is 270k Bravado is 219k and Brave is 294k) Should have a DX2-66 with 8 mb ram to run properly. Brave was released previously at over 330k but I pared it down to 290k by reducing halls and extra redundant chambers that wouldn't detract from the over all game. BREEZE is the only brand new release in this TRILOGY ( I have spent all together too much time indulging my hobby ! ) and if you have my previous offering, Bravado, in which Brave was included, you dont need this big file; however, Breeze is E2M1 so you can play it first and decided what you want to do after that.",
