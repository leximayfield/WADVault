Come to life get the weapons & KILL or be KILLED!!!!! If you want fewer monsters in the way, use -skill 1 on the command line. If you want more, use medium or hard. It can be played single & there are PLENTY of baddies w/skill level 3+. The weps will be scattered around in different places on single play.There are different ways to play this level to produce enjoyable results...Enjoy...:-*)# (My preferred method is w/4 people netDOOM...)",
