This Single level .WAD will (hopefully) suprise some of the expert players. And wait until you find out who your \"Comrades\" turn out to be. :) My Beta tester always loves to used the cheat codes, so my levels will always try to have some sort of trap that will \"get-cha\" even with the codes. (Not counting the no-clipping code) This one is no exception. There IS one (or two) certain spot(s) in which there is no way out other than starting over. I sure hope you didn't save in there? :)",
