	"description": "5 maps designed for PrBoom+ complevel 9. Play on HNTR or HMP. I spent the vast majority of time working on HNTR and HMP for maps 01-03. UV is an extra special difficulty that most likely only I will find fun. Maps31 and 32: These two maps are special bonus maps. Only UV is implemented for Map31. Map32 has HNTR, HMP, and UV implemented but I recommend almost everyone play HNTR on Map32. Difficulty descriptions: HNTR: I dont really play slaughter/I rarely play slaughter HMP: I like slaughter maps but it definitely isnt my primary focus. UV: I love going up against overwhelming odds, fighting tens (sometimes hundreds) of cybs/viles at a time, pain elemental swarms, Reality category of speedrunning. Due to the nature of these maps I recommend playing with infinite height off in ZDoom based ports due to the flying monster behavior mixed with high ceilings. These maps were designed for PrBoom+ cl9 which has vanilla flying monster behavior. Because of my mapping preferences play in software mode for best visual results!",
