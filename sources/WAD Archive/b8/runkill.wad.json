	"description": "This level is to be intended as a sort of exercise. I made it because I wanted to practise in editing Doom levels, before working again on my big projects. So don't wait for a detailed map, but for a difficult level. I focused my attention more on the difficulty of the level than on the graphics and architecture. So you will face hard fights! About graphics, the best- looking area is the court-yard beyond the two locked doors. Some suggestions: 1) don't waste your ammo; 3) don't kill all the monsters, otherwise you can find yourself without ammo; 4) if you are in trouble, try to run away; 5) be careful, because there are a lot of tricks and traps.",
