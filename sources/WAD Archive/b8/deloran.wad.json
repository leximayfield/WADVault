	"description": "Deloran is a fast paced wad with small maps. It was created in the time frame of 5 days and with no knowledge at all. I've had a couple of people playing it including Bzplasma. Overall i think the map has done me a great favor and more maps will come for sure. Must be played with either - Project Brutality - Or Brutal doom",
