	"description": "This one has an interesting history. At the beginning I just tried what I can build in 1 hour. So I didn't think about the layout at all. I just placed vertexes all around like mad. And as I found the wad not so bad, I spent another hour with aligning textures, making special deathmatch starts on pedestals. But I still took the result as a fast patchwork and laid it off until we tried deathmatch several weeks later. And oala, we liked it. So I spent another 3 hours with monsters, new graphics, making additional changes for solo game. And this is the result. Enjoy the wad!",
