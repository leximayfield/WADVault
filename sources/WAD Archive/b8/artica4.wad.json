	"description": "Much Different from the last three maps, this one involves a system of labs and experiments that someone(the people of Artica I'd assume)have done with a few monsters. These people, who you will soon find out were highly advanced technologicaly, have figured out ways to brainwash some of the demons so they will help you out. Sadly this plot never got finished because the monsters destroyed all the inhabitants before the plan could be fully executed. Also the Articans found a gateway to the monsters dimension(aka Hell)but anyone who has tried to go there hasn't come back. They have also harnessed the ability to teleport, something thought to be a Hellspawn only ability. They have also trapped some of the monsters so they are of no danger. Of course you don't know what switch will let something loose that's pretty pissed off for being captured in the first place.",
