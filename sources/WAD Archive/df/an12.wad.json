	"description": "I started mapping back in 2012, and during that early period of excitedly screwing around with DB2 I made a half dozen maps for a couple different projects that all amounted to nothing. They were sitting in a random folder gathering dust until I found them and thought they were charming enough to warrant sharing. The first two maps were made when I had no idea whatsoever how map formats or engine specifications worked, so I just made them in UDMF becuse that's what I was told to do. Then I found vanilla/limit removing, and things get a lot more straightforward from there.",
