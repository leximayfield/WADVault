But, just before entering the teleport zone, which should have sent you back in you era, you received a message from Gal Mac Porter ordering you to seek Hell Order agents by the tunnels of the castle you cleaned. A bad foreboding comes to your mind, tunnels can be full of tricks and traps. Don't shut one eye, keep your mind in activity, and your reflexes ready to face this part of the castle and to stay alive. May luck be with you !",
