	"description": "Just run this wad along with other wad(s) you're playing to enable regeneration. It works the same way it does in modern shooters: if you take no damage for a short while your health will start to regenerate back up. Taking the damage at this point will cancel out the ongoing regeneration until you take no damage for a short while again.",
