These are levels that have been built over a period of time from the release of the first DEU editor. Since Quake is expected soon I figured why let this .WAD go to waste. I want others to enjoy the same gameplay my friends and I have enjoyed over the years. The deathmatch is so much better with this wad. play it with a buddy and you'll see what i mean. You will laugh and cringe at the same time.",
