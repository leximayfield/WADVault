SInce I've been doing a lot of Quake lately I tried to add in a lot of cool architecture on the roof and stuff... nothing compared to my Quake levels but relative to the average doom level the architecture is pretty good. I like the look: metal2/brown96 /teklite texturing scheme, a large tower/building which somehow survived the apocalypse.",
