	"description": "This replaces the chaingun with the M16 from the Platoon TC for Duke Nukem 3D by The TNT Team. I know Don Tello has already done something like it in Dt-m16.zip, but he added a hand to the M16, and I wanted a version without it. This >should< work with Doom, Doom II, and any of the source ports. It has been tested with Boom, Zdoom, and Smack My Marine Up. I recomend using it with a port that has a good crosshair, like Smack My Marine Up.",
