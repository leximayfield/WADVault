	"description": "A small map created using only textures from Noir texture pack. It's quite dark, scary and pretty difficult. It was sort of inspired by Lab X-18 from Stalker and has quite a few design aspects borrowed from it. Don't forget, you need Noir pack to play it. You can download it from R667: http://realm667.com/index.php/en/component/docman/?task=doc_download&gid=951&Itemid=",
