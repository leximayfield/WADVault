	"description": "JUST ANOTHER DEATHMATCH LEVEL. IT REPLACES EPISODE 2 LEVEL 1. IT IS AN EIGHT SIDED ARENA THAT DEEPENS AND DARKENS AS YOU MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE. EACH PLAYER CAN ONLY HAVE ONE WEAPON PER LIFE AND IT IS CHOSEN RANDOMLY. EVERY WEAPON IS AVAILABLE, BUT YOU ONLY HAVE A ONE IN ELEVEN CHANCE OF GETTING THE BFG. ALSO, TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM JUST STANDING AROUND IN THE DARK, THERE ARE TWO CYBER DEMONS SPICING UP THE ATMOSPHERE. THEIR SHOTS ARE EASY TO AVOID, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP MOVING. THE EXITS ARE LOCATED ON THE WALLS BEHING THE WEAPONS.",
