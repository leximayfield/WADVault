	"description": "This is a very good deathmatch level that's made for deathmatch 2.0. It works well with 2 players and it should be awesome with 4, but I haven't tested it. It is a large size level that goes pretty fast. There is a no exit. All weapons are available. Made Bfg harder to get in ver.2 This level is a must for everybody that plays deathmatch. I tried to base the level around the movie nightbreed..the place they hung out was called \"Midian\"..which is also my bbs's name.=) The level is pure havoc.",
