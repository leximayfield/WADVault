	"description": "An 'interesting' wad which (unintentionally) shows off the learning curve I've been through in the last 4 years. It's got a very loose story centred around a 'Hell on Earth' sort of theme, just from a more civilian viewpoint. This is now on v1.2, but only the ZDoom forumers would have got the original release(s).",
