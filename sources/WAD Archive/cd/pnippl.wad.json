	"description": "The Doom guy is going to the store to buy tacos, but on the way home the monsters steal them! He follows them to the fabled PN Slime Base, maintained by the evil PN Corporation who for some reason works for the UAC and they have some of their crates in there. The Doom guy asks for the tacos back, because he could never bring himself to harm a monster. They give an apology and return his tacos, then invite him inside to play Scrabble! The Doom guy says he would love to, and that he will see them there soon! The truth is, though, that the Doom guy was lying and he wants to destory all the monsters. The tacos can wait. There's Hell to pay.",
