	"description": "10 Levels for Zdoom, Plus 2 secret levels. Each level has all new challenges awaiting you. Plenty of use of the features in Zdoom like stealth enemies. There are also some new enemies capable of peforming the most unexpected tricks. There is no scripting this wad because I havent figured it out. There are 3 new types of Cacodemon, 1 new Cybderdemon, 1 new Mancubus 2 new Hell Knights. You're mission is to Save the backpack from the white Super Cybderdemon and kill yet another giant spider. Secret exits are in Level 1 and 8, both are extremley difficult to figure out.",
