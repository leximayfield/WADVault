But, unfortunately, forces are unequal and many of your friends are dying. Rebelion Chiefs decided to send you back to Middle Ages to find a solution. At this time, Hell Order squads were not so numerous. In fact, it was the begining of their infiltration and they just started to manipulate influent people like lords, clerics and kings. So, your mission is to go back there and to eliminate all Hell Order agents you'll find. It will not be a funny trip, keep in mind that trick and strategy are your best allies. Try to avoid as possible as you can frontal assaults to complete your mission.",
