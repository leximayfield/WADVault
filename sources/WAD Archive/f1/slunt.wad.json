	"description": "This wad is unique in some ways. It's definately a kill fest, and wad designed as so. It's basically a very large room with an outer circle. Teleports abound, monsters abound. Try it as a deathmatch. When the monsters run thin, go get some more. There's a teleport in a dark area where there's a mess 'o monsters, which you can easily summon. Just don't get killed. Playing by yourself is also possible, the intent being only, to kill everything, and to feel good about it. Coop will work as well, with the idea being, help each other kill the monsters! then go up to your partner, and shoot him in the back!",
