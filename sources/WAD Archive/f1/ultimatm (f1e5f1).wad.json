	"description": "Ultimatum is a project that I've had in mind for several years now. Basically, every mapper was randomly given a limitation made up from over the years of mapping, and what you see here is the results! A small warning: the difficulty curve is pretty steep, as there weren't any suggestions as to how easy or hard a map could be. Good luck!",
