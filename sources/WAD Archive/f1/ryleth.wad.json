	"description": "Part 2 of the necropolis wad. after discovering the entrance to the aliens castle you find a strange place with impossible architecture that defies logic. Now you must enter RY'leth, home of Cthulhu. UAC reports that a strange gateway was found at a Mars mining colony. several barons were captured before the base was overrun revealing that somewhere in there is the Entrance to RY'leth. Your commander says you'll know the entrance by the elder sign sealing it closed. a green star of unusual design. and.... by the fact that the more insane you become the closer you are to Cthulhu himself. you'll see things that are'nt there and halls will appear longer than they really are!!",
