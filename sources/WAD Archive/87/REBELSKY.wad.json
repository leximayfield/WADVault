	"description": "You've heard about the demonic invasion on earth, how legions of dark, mysterious creatures appeared out of the depths of darkness - bringing with them a blood red sky that threatens to set the very atmosphere on fire wherever they tread. The unknown fear of humanity now has a face - after many squadrons of troops have long disappeared, you are now tasked to infiltrate the haunted headquarters of this entity. It appears this hidden castle fortress is being converted into a staging ground for another invasion - many troops have attacked this effort, but communications have short-circuited, leaving many questions unanswered. Now the operation rests in your hands with uncertainty... You were supposed to teleport to a flooded graveyard outpost leading to this fortress, but a slight miscalculation traps you in a crowded hall surrounded by locked doors. It seems this headquarters has been partially built into a fully-functioning gateway for the hellspawn, and they've locked down hard in response to previous wanderers. Your job now is to solve this monstrosity they've constructed by releasing these hidden doorways, and acquire the three keys needed to seal their path into the physical realm. Doing this should hinder their effort of continually spawning these nightmares of humanity that have long been sealed away to prevent their return strategy, and pray that the rest of the commandos working elsewhere have been successful in keeping the others away. If you remain trapped in these headquarters, you may never see the light of day again...",
