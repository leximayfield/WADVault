	"description": "This level is based on the library of the university, and I also included the gardens and the outer part of the coffe shop (that big hole next to the gardens). The chapel is not very accurately represented, but it's recognizable. A friend gave me the idea to make this wad; I think it's cool to deathmatch you buddies in a place that you know in real life. Anyway, for those of you who've never seen the campus, this is a chance to be there. You can play this level in single-player mode, but it's rather boring. I built it with DeathMatch in mind.",
