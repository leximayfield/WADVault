	"description": "A fun, well-crafted wad. There's some nice lighting effects, long halls, twisty passages, enourmous courtyards, some suprising connections between areas, a few reasonably clever layout tricks and a quite extraordinary use of an elevator at the end. It is challenging without being ridiculous; no mobs of cacademons here, thank goodness. Vince put a lot of work into making this look good; you won't have that depressing \"generic\" feel (\"ooh! Concrete!\") while playing this wad. --Barry",
