	"description": "MDK Armory is a dumb weapon pack inspired by the ZDoom console command/cheat \"mdk,\" which deals 10,000 damage to whatever you're pointing at. As such, every weapon deals 10,000 damage. It's a jokewad that will hopefully provide catharsis and might prove fun to anyone who wants to experience slaughterwads extremely casually.",
