	"description": "This level was designed primarily as a three to four player deathmatch, but it can also be played through as a single player game. The level is based round a large central cavernous room containing four gun turrets. As a deathmatch level, the best places to be (in terms of where to find weapons and good ambush/sniper points) are also the most dangerous. These are the deadzones.",
