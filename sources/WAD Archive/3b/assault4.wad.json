	"description": "Assault4:Mineshaft is a trio of new levels for Doom II. New graphics, new sounds, new music, and a new monster are among the highlights. We have payed close attention to detail, all textures are properly aligned and all difficultly levels have been implemented. MAP 01: Contact has been lost with the mining colony on a distant moon. You have already investigated the base to find it completely deserted. On this level you will explore the upper levels of the mining complex. Find a way to activate the lift and gain access into the lower levels of the mines. (The new monster appears near the end of this level).",
