	"description": "Tiny Boom (-complevel 9) speedmap that I made while helping a friend get into mapping after the last Joy of Mapping (3) session. We mapped for 3 hours, then spent another on bug fixes, touch- ups, and cackling like hens about our nails and the feathering of our hair. I got some feedback and made a couple quick, minor changes... all- in-all about 4.5 hours of work. The map takes 5 minutes or less to beat and features rocket- centric, light-slaughter gameplay. Difficulty settings are implemented, though admittedly HNTR is a joke setting. Still, HMP is a much easier, more casual experience. Uses textures from Jimmy and a sky from Mech. Midi \"Phrygia\" comes from Battle of Olympus NES game.",
