	"description": "A nine level episode where the theme is set in a castle environment that is meant to be a challenge. There are 3 Demos to watch to supply hints and show off some of the land. Included is new fantastic music to keep you going. The music is pure pleasure for those who have a General-Midi music device. There are new monsters: A Seargent that looks similar to the player for multi-player confusion, Death's Shadow replacing the imps. You will find that the levels get increasingly more challenging to level 5 and eases off on levels 6 and 7 and becomes hard again on level 8. Level 9 is only tough if you insist on destroying every demon. Remember, this level is built so that you will never become trapped. Every room that has an entrance, has an exit! (Note: as a challenge, I mean without using cheat codes!)",
