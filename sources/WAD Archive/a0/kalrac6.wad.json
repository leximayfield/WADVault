	"description": "This level is based on the layout and design of the first dungeon of the old Nintendo game \"The Legend of Zelda\". I don't know why I thought of doing it, but once I thought of it, I immediately set out to make a level from it. It is a pretty accurate import of the original level, items are in the same places, all the enemies are there, etc. Even the Triforce piece is present.",
