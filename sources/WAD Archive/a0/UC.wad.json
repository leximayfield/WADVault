	"description": "The Ultimate Challenge is full of Nasty Monsters. And for the solo player may prove to much. You can always cheat. There is plenty of weapons and ammo and even a few secret areas. It is possible to win. At the directory in which you have doom2 located type doom2 -file UC.wad. This should replace the regular map1 with the challenge of a doomer's lifetime. Good Luck",
