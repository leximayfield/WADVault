	"description": "This wad includes new sprites for players in deathmatch. O.K., not so new sprites, in fact I just replaced the old face with helmet with MY face. But can I say it is really me in the arena? No. 1) I don't smoke 2) I am not so good artist to catch my face in 10x10 pixels. Anyway, I hope you will try this in your next deathmatch session and tell me whether you liked my new death sequences.",
