	"description": "A feast for the eyes of those who thirst for blood. Indulge yourself with nine classically designed levels of fine architecture with fast and furious action, a puzzle or two thrown in just for fun, and a silly story line. These huge levels are all packed full of monsters, of course, to keep you busy throughout the wee hours of the night and well into the morning. Don't let the blood and viscera of hundreds of slaughtered beasts spoil the beauty of your surroundings.",
