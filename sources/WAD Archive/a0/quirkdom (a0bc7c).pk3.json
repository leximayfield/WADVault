	"description": "This map was made for a closed group project that was abandoned. I didn't want the map to go to waste so I decided to release it stand-alone. It uses a lot of non-euclidean geometry as its gimmick (portals). Also, Nightmare! difficulty has its own monsters/items separate from Ultra-Violence and is without respawning monsters. There is no backstory/excuse plot here. Have fun!",
