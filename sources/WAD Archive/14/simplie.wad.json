	"description": "This is a fun level for Doom 2 called Simply Dead. You kill 2 hanging toy like things and a fatso and then have some hard fights with archviles and the exit is really interesting. I dont know why people hate my levels but I think you will like this because I tried my hardest to get the layout done to perfection.",
