	"description": "Simple(ish) layout. One largish area intended for free flowing duels. The rest is more tight. Basically a circle with a cross in the middle and one corner of the circle made much larger. The left hand side is high - steps round the outer part of the level and though the middle. An excellent level for double backs and cut off manovers. Lurking is not very profitable BFG and plasma are hard to get. Plasma on a lift BFG on a strafe run platform. Personally I think the DB shotgun RULES this level though.. Skill 1 has been optimized for alt-deathmatch. All other skill levels are meant for REAL deathmatch :) One bit of armour and various health and ammo bits lying about. Lots of S.shotguns on this skill level so you don't run out too quick.",
