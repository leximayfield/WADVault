	"description": "Just a little mod that replaces the yellow key with a red one. I made this for use in Shadowcaster, but due to the sprite-based nature of the red key stuff, it didn't take long to work out that it could be used anywhere, really. So here it is - play any wad you want with it, use it in your own wad if you want to.",
