	"description": "The Castle of Iresnome was a newer heretic level I had made because we have played my last level (TEMPLE.WAD) for about a month. It is IDEAL for 4 player deathmatch and that is all. There is no finish to the level. It is for deathmatch and for deathmatch alone. It is awesome though. Everyone seems to think so at least.",
