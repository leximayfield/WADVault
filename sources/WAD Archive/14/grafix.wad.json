	"description": "This wad replaces the death animations of all Doom2 characters with the exception of the specter, Keen, the Wolfenstein soldier. Some of the monster's death animations vary. I have greatly altered some while hardly touching others as there is little I found I could do. The baron of hell and the hell knight are two good examples of that. However, there should be a noticeable difference in most of the deaths. Enjoy! >:D",
