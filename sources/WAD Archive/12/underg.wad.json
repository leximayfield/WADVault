	"description": "This level really kicks ass. It's a bit HUGE though. Even if you know what you're doing, it probably would take a good hour or so to complete. PLEASE PLEASE try it the first time WITHOUT the Doom cheaty codes. We dare ya to. And remember, SAVE OFTEN! ;D BTW, it seems more people have DOOM2 than DOOM, so many of you will be converting this over to DOOM2. But TRY at least once, to play it in it's original DOOM format. But really, this level is, although made by myself, one of my favorites (especially in multi-player mode). I had a lot of fun making this level.",
