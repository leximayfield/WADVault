	"description": "Wexman Wad, 27 levels of pure Deathmatch excitement. Once you have played this Wad, all other Deathmatchs will seem like walks in the Park, and half as enjoyable. This is the only complete 27 level Pwad that is designed for deathmatch that I know of. Not only are the levels made for deathmatch, but the new graphics have been used so you can't get board of a level. Also new music has been written, if your a serious deathmatcher you've probably heard the DOOM music thousands of time, well this Pwads will be a nice break then. Also the sounds will not let you down, well, just listen to them, I'm sure that you can figure it out. This Pwad was designed for deathmatch, all the levels have 8 deathmatch starting location and at least 8 sets of complete weapons (shotgun, chaingun, plasma gun, rocket launcher), only a few selected levels have the BFG 9000. No level has a secrets to find, so if one player knows where the secret is and the other does not they have an advantage. All the levels were designed with fairness in mind so the best Deathmatcher will win.",
