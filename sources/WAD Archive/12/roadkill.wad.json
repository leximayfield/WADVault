	"description": "This wad is designed for SINGLE PLAY--and it's BIG! Lots of room to run--lots of intricate scenery. And, of course, lots of monsters. It includes many buildings--including my entire file, \"Building\" [Dmbld.wad] (modified of course). A long and winding road runs through this urban scenario, shops and factories on all sides. It's a human city--sickened with alien invaders.",
