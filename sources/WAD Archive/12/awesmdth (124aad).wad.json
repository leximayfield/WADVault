	"description": "Awesmdth.wad is a single level for map 01 of Doom2, and was designed with new deathmatch in mind. It's a small level consisting of an outdoor area surrounded by rooms, canals o' death, and ledges. It's a very basic setup, but it's deathmatch fun for the whole family. A guaranteed frag o' rama. It's got a layout that flows just at the right speed for deathmatch. However I included single play and co-op play at skill 4. Don't look behind that wall! The level supports 4 players for co-op and deathmatch, and skill levels function, to some extent. It has a co-op exit though. A must have for deathmatch enthusiasts. Just play it and e-mail me with any flames, suggestions, praises. It's only my second wad so be nice. Hope you like it. Download waldorf.wad also.",
