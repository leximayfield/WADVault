You can play it with the normal DEATHMATCH rules if you like, but it'll definetely work best with 2 vs 2= 4 players are therefore needed! As mentioned there are 2 Teams: A BLUE and a RED team. The green and the Indigo player are the BLUE team while the brown and the red player are the RED team. Got it? :) Now, each team has it's own \"hood\", call it whatever you like.... Every player always start in the \"starting-room\" in the beginning of each game and whenever a player dies... there's 4 teleports on the blue side of the \"starting- room\" which will take you to the blue \"hood\" and there's 4 teleports on the red side of the \"starting-room\" which surely will take you to the red \"hood\"... but you can easily cross into the other team's hood to get some cheap frags and steal the weapons and goodies. This is *NOT* DeathTag though if you got that idea. The rules are simple: Get as many frags as possible! If you unfortunately kill your own partner, the frag you got will not count...you must instead do a -1 frag to your score!",
