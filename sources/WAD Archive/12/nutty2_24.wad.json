	"description": "\"After so many players enjoyed The Nutty Wad and since Cybershark and me still had so many leftover ideas and maps, we soon decided to continue the nutty work with a sequel. The last official version was nutty2_20.wad in december 2005 with 20 maps. It turned out to have some immature maps though. The next release should have had those problems fixed, but it never saw the light of the day. The project was cancelled in February 2007.\" - Milian",
