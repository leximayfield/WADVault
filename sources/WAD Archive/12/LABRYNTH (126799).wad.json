	"description": "Unique Deathmatch wad, with a \"dynamic\" maze configuration. The maze is below ground, but you can run across the top of it w/o falling in--nice pseudo-3D effect. Of course, you can really confuse your opponents by changing the maze around while they're in it... but there's always a way out.",
