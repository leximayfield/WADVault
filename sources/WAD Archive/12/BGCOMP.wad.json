	"description": "A 3 episode vanilla megawad for Doom 1 containing a total of 27 maps. Set on one of Jupiter's moons called Ganymede, this wad should provide a challenge for a wide variety of skill levels ranging from the humble newbie to veteran speedrunner. Each episode has it's own progression rather than the usual base -> hellbase -> hell.",
