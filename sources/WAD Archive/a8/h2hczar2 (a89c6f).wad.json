	"description": "This is another arena-type deathmatch pwad that I made for the H2H DOOM BBS in San Diego (619-426-0073). Arenas are made for altdeath and should be small enough for two players. I did my best to offer some enjoyment also for those who can play just solo. Small hint: be very carefull where you run, expect heavy monsters and conserve ammo.",
