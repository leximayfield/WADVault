	"description": "For those Doomers who dislike puzzles, but do like the blood and guts, this is the Wad for you. Actually a good training mission for multi-player gamers. The setup is fifty plus rooms of bad guys. The doors are narrow so players will have to take turns being point. I don't believe the level is completable in single player mode without a major Dehacked job.",
