	"description": "This level was originally a small deathmatch concept, but needed some additions to improve playability. This level is moderate in size and has been designed for 2 Player Deathmatch. It also plays well as a one player episode. There are a few hidden doors, but they should be easy to spot. Two teleporters. A hidden exit, but it is revealed fairly easily. Monsters are copious in UV, and there is a spiderdemon. Not too tough to get though, because of the location. View the .lmp to see basically the entire level in UV. (Apologize for my performance as I only had the keyboard at the time) (doom -playdemo sniper99 -file sniper99.wad) Comments, criticisms very welcome.",
