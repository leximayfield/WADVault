With the ability to create any environment, situation, dream, or battle, the Holodome has tested every Marine currently on earth. The failure of this final test is much worse than non-admittance to the ranks of marines: failure inevitably means death. Today is your chance to graduate from simple grunt forces to acceptance as a full marine. Your Test: Journey through the dethmaze in search of the Blue keycard, which grants you the only door from the Holodome... But beware! With luck, you will only be up against computer-generated aliens, souls, ect. But if Lady Luck has thrown you to the wolves, you'll find your selflocked in a maze with only one other,a thinking, fighting grunt like yourself, aimed on destroying anyone or anything in his path to becoming a marine! Your only hope of surviving this is the destruction of your counterpart! You stand at the edge of the pit to the Holodome with a shotgun found in your current room. with a box of shells. Now only YOU control your fate, my friend!",
