	"description": "I decided to create a wad that will fulfill the needs of AVGN fans. The character pretty much rages just like the AVGN. The weapon you get is a NES Zapper, along with a secret weapon not related to AVGN. There are two levels. MAP01-Game Lab You start in a lab and you work your way outside, to kill and get rid of monsters. The exit is to kill the barons of hell. There is one secret. PORTNUKE-Portable Nuke Test Map This isn't really an AVGN map, but it was a pretty cool think to try out.",
