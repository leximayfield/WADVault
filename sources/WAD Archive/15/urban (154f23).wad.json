	"description": "My first real DM level! I do not know whether or not it will fulfil DM demands and rules in design and gameplay. I just felt that I needed to build a DM level...and I did. The level contains what I would classify as basic and \"useful\" elements in a DM level. There are not any switches, keys or traps. But, all the guns plenty of ammo. Some places are good for hiding, some better for sniping and some made for the Rambo type, if ya know what I mean. But, but, but....do not fall into despair my singleplayer friends. I HAVE placed monsters in the level...though without skill levels. I really hate to see an excellent, in every way, DM level, only to find out that you cannot play it with monsters! There must be something for everybody to enjoy in a level!",
