	"description": "I wanted to create a level that kept changing layout as the player progresses. This means a lot of lowering walls and floors... and perhaps some bloody surprises too! It is a medium sized level with a moderate amount of monsters. There should be plenty of ammo and health. The ambitions for this level from my part was merely to create a no-bullshit map that is fun to play.",
