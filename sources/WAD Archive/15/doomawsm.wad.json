	"description": "Remember episode 1, the original? Remember how simple it is? Simple architecture, simple detail, simple puzzles. That's what made all of the original episodes KICK ASS. For years people took this single episode, a monument to the perfection of gameplay, and tried to replicate it. For a while it was enough. Not anymore. Nowadays, the only acceptable type of Doom wad is the kind that feels as little like Doom as possible. But when it gets to that point... who the hell cares about Doom? Why mod for a game which people still play for its simplicity if what you're going to try to accomplish is make it seem as modern as possible? Why mod for Doom, of all games? Well, whatever. I can't do anything about it. But I can make something. Here is a set of nine simple, but fun levels. Hopefully they will hold some feeling of nostalgia, as well as serve as a reminder of why we love Doom.",
