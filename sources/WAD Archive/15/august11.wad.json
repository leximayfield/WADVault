	"description": "A level for DEATHMATCH only! Based on the wood textures with a dim light most places. In this level you'll find it useful to jump...snipe... jump...snipe...they're alot of different highs in this level and the big weapons are placed so you must jump in some way to get them. First time I use this princip but it surely *rocks*! Pick skill 1/2/3 if you don't want the BFG. 2 players are ideal for a fast game. Anyway, it seems that there are *several* ways to get the weapons...especially you may find many \"shortcuts\" to get the *big* weapons. A little but complex level for serious DOOMers! ! There are 2 exits on the level and the secret one ! ! is just for purely fun in case you wonder... ! Hope you enjoy August11.wad!",
