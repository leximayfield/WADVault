	"description": "\"Well, well, well...\" started Hades, \"You have solved that little puzzle(*) with amazing speed... Good for you, my boy. How about something tougher?\" Answering your icy glance, he quickly added \"Okay, just a _little_ tougher...\" His wide smile exposed strong and healthy teeth. Suddenly it came to your mind that no one ever saw Hades smiling -- or did not live to tell about it? \"The problem is,\" he continued, \"that I have one little palace I don't really like. One architect designed it for me some time ago, he was trying to suck up to me, you know, so I would let him live another 50 years or so. I didn't. Anyway, the place didn't suit my taste, really; it's so small and tight, and definitely not warm enough for a winter palace. So I decided that with some remodeling it would make an interesting puzzle for you. How about it? Oh, come on, I know you start to like these puzzles, don't you?\" His voice became more and more patronizing. \"It's good, you know, for your body, mind... and speed!\" he said, and honoured you with another smile, clearly enjoying himself. Impatience, however, overcame him, and he quickly finished up his monologue -- \"You are really good in conversations. It's a pity we've got to go now. I can't wait to see you in that palace. I only wonder how quickly you'll get out of there... IF you'll get out...",
