	"description": "Should be OK on 486/33 SX or DX with 8 MB RAM, and a zippy video card. Quite a large level with lots to kill and a few puzzles to solve. I played it a couple of times so I know it can be done. Unfortunately, there's a couple of small areas where the mirroring effect persists, and I just couldn't get rid of it! I'm not going to tell you to be careful and save the game often etc etc, cos you'll play it your own way anyhow.",
