	"description": "My last map was an entry to Metabolist's Wad-in-a-week contest -- it was called The Archvile's Revenge (for good reason). This one is the Cyberdemon's revenge. Most players will want to play Hurt Me Plenty(if anything)... UV is geared for the Cyber-freaks out there. My maps are ugly, so don't expect much. Created in about 4 hours... wound up playing it more than editing, I think.",
