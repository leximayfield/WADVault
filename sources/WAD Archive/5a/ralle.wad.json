	"description": "I created this PWAD long time ago only to try Deathmach in a network. It didn't work and I forgot it. Now I found it again and saw that it was good. So Jesus came down and said to me: \"Do some texture-aligning and it will be good.\" And it was good. And on the third day I builded this text and I saw that it was good. And on the fourth day I rested from my work, so the fourth day is a holy one... (Try out: THOS_02.wad, STAIRS.wad, LIFT.wad, CYRC.wad, CROSS.wad, ASYM.wad and all the other Pwads I've created...)",
