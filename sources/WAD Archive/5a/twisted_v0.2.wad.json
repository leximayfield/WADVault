	"description": "Twisted Dimension is the best of my works so far, and also the most creative. It's originally based off of my very old map Death Arena, in which you would enter a room and kill all of the monsters it contained to gain acess to the next room. I 'based' the first few rooms off of Death Arena, but then later started making it much more different. Also keep in mind that this map is somewhat linear, but I'm hoping you'll still enjoy it.",
