	"description": "Started in 2009-ish, Coffee Break was intended to be another 32 map megawad. Unfortunately, due to a busy schedule, laziness, and other excuses, I didn't finish it. But I do have 11 maps, so there's that. Submitted for your approval are 11 short maps designed to challenge all sorts of Doomers. All were made with lots of tender love and care, and with pistol starts in mind.",
