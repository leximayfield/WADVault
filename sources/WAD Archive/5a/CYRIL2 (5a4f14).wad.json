	"description": "This is my second level of DOOM. It's designed to be played in Single player mode at any difficulty level. I hope for you that you know what's a joystick and how to use it, and I hope for you that you know how to walk without seeing your feets. The music is from Iron Maiden (or Metallica, I can't remember).It is called \"The call of Cthulu\". Great with SB AWE 32",
