	"description": "Hey there, here comes a very good WAD. I worked so hard, therefore maps are beautiful. Come and check it. Really, I used all of my imagination. Maps are interesting, so don't give up when you are killed or bored. It can't be boring. As always, maps are hard, but still balanced (you can pass it on every skill level). Enough medkits and ammo. Well, I added new monster. Don't remember exactly, but 5 - 6, which you can find (no doubt you will) on the second level. Some of them are scary, some of them are difficult, so mind your head. A lot of secrets were created, but some of them are really hard to be found. Just try to think about obvious places (click \"use\" on them, or shoot). Actually, there are 3 maps in this WADs, but the last one was created only to finish the whole game. 1st and 2nd are the main action. No new weapons were added, don't like them. Almost always they have bugs. Despite the name of the WAD is RAMMSTEIN, I didn't use their songs on maps or in intermission. Wanna hear their songs in Doom? Welcome to MINDFIELDS.wad ;) By the way, to the EXTERNAT.wad as well. If you want to try my updated EXTERNAT.wad - ask me by e-mail. I changed tables into 3D and fixed some bugs.",
