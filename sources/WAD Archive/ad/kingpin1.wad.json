	"description": "Medium-sized level for Doom ][, designed for single player. This is the final release that fixes a few texture alignments and adds some lighting enhancements. Your mission is to penetrate the residence of a Drug Lord,eliminate all resistance,and escape without falling prey to the temptations within.As you approach the entrance, you're shot with some kind of a dart. You pull it from your arm,and all too suddenly,things start getting strange. Panic grips you,and all you can do now is let instinct hurl you through this hallucinogenic craze!",
