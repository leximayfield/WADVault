	"description": "I tried to create a level that might have appeared in the Doom 2 game. I paid very close attention to textures to try to attain a very authentic atmosphere. This level is not impossible and is fun to play. Since there are red, yellow, and blue doors, it is not a very good deathmatch level; so I didn't even include deathmatch starts.",
