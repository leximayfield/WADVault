	"description": "UAC Outpost Nine was invaded by alien lifeforms. A reconnaissance squad of ten was sent in to assess the situation and secure the outpost. The squad leader reported that the outpost personnel had been killed, and were perhaps cloned for alien soldiers. The last contact with the squad leader was a request for reinforcements -- losing assets fast! There was no contact with the squad leader for twenty-four hours. Since all divisions had been committed to the ongoing battle for the Earth, we turnd to you. Since you were stationed at HQ, we could only arm you with your sidearm. But hey, you're trained Marine, with combat experience -- besides, you've done nothing but bitch about your desk job. You've made it through the outpost entryway, and the Underhalls below. You even managed to escape from the solitary cell and ran the gauntlet to get out of that fortified prison. The alien command post at the very center of the outpost proved to be no challenge as did the outpost waste tunnels. Now you must face the deadly crusher. Will it crush you, or your new friends?",
