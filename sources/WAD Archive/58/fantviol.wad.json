	"description": "The idea for this level came from that old science fiction movie, _Fantastic Voyage_. The pitiful excuse for a plot is: Having been defeated soundly by conventional warfare, the Demons decide to attack from within... They develop a Hell-virus which spawns tiny horrors within, transforming the victim into one of their zombies. The carrier has been identified and isolated in time, and it's your job to be miniaturised and go in there to learn all you can about the infection and wipe it out. Enter through the mouth, exit most unpleasantly! Basically, it's just an excuse to use a whole level's worth of sloppy, organic textures.",
