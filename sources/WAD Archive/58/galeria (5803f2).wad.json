	"description": "This Level represents the ultimative two player Deathmatch arena. There are some (we call it \"galeria\") windows to shoot out and some fine dark rooms and of course a chainsaw-arena (with nasty doors). This level's seize is good for reaching your opponent fast and intercept it. Nothing for wimps who try to escape or hide (you guys will be hunted easily). We haven't tried it, but we think that this level is too small for a good 4 player Match. This version is much harder in the ultra violence mode ! 2 spiders and a Cyber Demon ! The people wanted a harder version of LA GALERIA for single player, so here it is :-))",
