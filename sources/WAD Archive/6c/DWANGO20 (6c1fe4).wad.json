	"description": "31 maps created between 1994 and 1998 by the Dooming community of yesteryear, and a map by myself. There's a nice mix of duel maps and all-out FFA maps which seem to have been lost in time, and I thought it was appropriate for Dwango's 20th anniversary to bring them back to the surface! All of these WADs give consent for distribution - check DWANGO20_DOCS for more information. Map01 was created in the spirit of DWANGO and can also be found in DK_DM_2.wad, but this version is better :)",
