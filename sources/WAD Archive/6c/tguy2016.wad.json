	"description": "Back when Doom was shiny, new and exciting, in June 1994, Rick Farmer released a level which he named TOUGHGUY.WAD. The main gimmick of the level were \"silent teleporters\". Kinda. The level came with a BAT file to replace the necessary sprites, but as it relied on DOS utilities, playing TOUGHGUY in 2016 is a pain in the neck. So I took the sacrifice, included all the sprites and sounds and released this for j00 to behold its tutti-fruttic 1994 magnificence. Other than the included sounds and sprites, I did NOT change a damn thing about this very tough wad.",
