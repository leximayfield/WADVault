	"description": "Playable singleplayer, co-op or deathmatch. The door to the Base opens, and you step out into a deep crater. The walls are steep, and too high to scale. Opposite, however, is a tunnel entrance, leading into darkness. You heft your chaingun and feel the reassuring weight of the rocket launcher on your back. Time to find out what's down there. Part 3 of a 7 level \"Episode\". As such the Solo game is fairly low key. (Think middle Knee Deep levels from Doom 1). The Multiplayer games have more weapons and monsters, but are still somewhat restrained. Good shots will do best here.",
