	"description": "This is a HUGE, three-key level designed mostly for solo and co-op play. Death Match is supported, but I would stay behind the yellow key boundary so that play is restricted to a tighter, more circular traffic pattern area. This pwad started as an experiment in trying out the new DCK ver. 2.2 editor. It was so much fun to use I couldn't stop! This editor is so far superior to anything I have ever used that I was able to really let my creativity run free! I'm sure you will appreciate the architectural detail, light and shadow detail (check-out the sundial!) and the challenging tricks and traps. My favorite way to play is on difficulty level #3.",
