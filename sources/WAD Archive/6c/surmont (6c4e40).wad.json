	"description": "X-Rated This wad may be considered X-rated by some. In my opinion, the nude shot in the bedroom is no more X-rated than the violence of the game. If it offends you don't play this wad. This was my home and horse farm...until a UAC C147 attempting to land at Dulles Airport, which I unfortunately happen to be under the N-S approach, crashed here. I'm not sure what happened but but apparently the C147 was carrying Toxic waste from the Spawning Pits which upon landing on my land began mutating all the animals who began spawning in my house, barns and out-buildings. In addition, the plants became mutated.... well to make a long story short I'm fucked unless you can save the farm.",
