	"description": "Fourth entry in a series of small vanilla doom maps in a space adventure built off personal nostalgia. Each entry consists of a two short maps: an introductory monsterless map with a single secret to find before tackling the mission, and the main map itself. I release them in the order they are made, but the difficulty depends on the map. Drown Stone Cassette A (just Drown Stone) is based on my submission for Snakes' Secret Santa project, in which I was tasked at imitating Forty-Two/stewboy's style. I originally planned on using this map as part of the Nebula 95 series, but I realized toward the end of making it that it didn't quite fit for a few reasons: it was boom-compatible, and it used new non-sky textures in the map, which sort of went against the style I had in mind for this series. I liked it too much the way it was though, so I released this version to the archive as Dstone.wad. For the second version (the one you're looking at), the resources were changed and it was optimized to be vanilla-compatible, which meant making changes to the architecture and gameplay of the map. If you want to play a more direct action-oriented styled map, try out DStone.wad. If you want to play a slightly more puzzle-oriented cheesy nineties version of the map, give this one a go.",
