	"description": "Ebola made a TC called Hyena, so I thought it would only be fitting for me to make a Doom Project with his name on it. Essentially, this is just a fun collection of 32 badly-detailed levels, geared towards making the player die. Note: Most levels automatically exit after you die, so don't hit the space bar or you'll start the level over again. A few bugs do exist, so if you end up waiting a long time after dying, just hit space and try again. Note #2: MAP30 does not have an exit. Presumably you will just die. It's possible to survive, though. If you get stuck, that's why.",
