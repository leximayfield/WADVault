I still have a little trouble with it, and I WROTE the darn thing :) It consists basically of a fairly complex sector structure, with some well-hidden secrets and ALOT of monsters :) Probably not a very good deathmatch, but haven't gotten to try that out yet because our local system is not allowing Doom multi for some reason.. :/ Anyway.. try it out and tell me what you think.. comments allowed and very much welcome. Bear with me, I'm new at this :)",
