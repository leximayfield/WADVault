	"description": "NESSUS is the 5th Canto in my INFERNO series. Minos decided to grant leniency and not kill you until next week. In the meantime, having slipped past Cerberus, the top dog, you and Virgil come to a precipice overlooking the river Phlegethon. There, Virgil greets the Minotaur using phrases from an out-of-date \"Passport to Demonese\" by Charles Berlitz. Enraged at having been asked to remove his panties, the Minotaur falls upon the ground and throws a conniption fit. You grab Virgil and climb down some boulders to the foot of the cliff where Chiron, the chief Centaur, offers to have Nessus carry you across the river on his shoulders. \"Why, that's mighty white of ya',\" says Virgil. \"No problem, sailor,\" says Nessus. \"Hop on.\" This is primarily a deathmatch level, but it's full of enough surprises to make single play quite challenging.",
