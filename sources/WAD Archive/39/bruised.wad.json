	"description": "This is an extremely difficult, large, fast moving, single player wad for Doom2. It was extensively tested by yours truly to insure that only the most skilled and determined players would finish it without cheats. Hint: every time you do something good--SAVE IT!! The opening sequence is particu- larly challenging. You have a pistol and are surrounded by six imps. The following is an explanation of how to do this part: Strafe and go thru the door straight ahead. Hug the left corridor wall and kill the first shotgunner. Hard left up the stairs, taking his shotgun behind the com- puter bank. Kill the chaingunner and get ready for a revenant who's already enroute. Play tag with the revenant for a while and... with a bit of luck, you just might survive this first part! The ammo situation improves from here but you gotta be smart and ro- tate weapons. There are five or six false walls in the wad with goodies and monsters behind them. Look for them and monsters coming out of them. There are two archviles in the wad, one cyberdemon and two spider mas- terminds. In the final room, if you are left standing before the exit door, everyone dead...there is a switch in one of the small rooms that opens up the exit door. Keep your eyes open..there are lots of tricks and traps... Any feedback or questions can be sent to me at Honto1@aol.com. Hope you enjoy it!",
