	"description": "This is a recent speedmapped Death match level utilizing marble textures, and a few bits of things I picked up from a FFA Session on ZDaemon. This is my second wad I have ever completed, and more than likely the first to be successfully uploaded to /idgames. This level is a square room with a surrounding ring, and two side rooms. Rocket Launcher, Chaingun, and Super Shotgun are in here as well as the BFG. I expect this to be lukewarm in terms of receiving by the community. This level has been updated to contain at least a single door. Constructive critising comments are welcome as well as the other.. posts that are frequent on here. Redesigned main arena, and added an Icon of Sin exit for Singleplayer only. I still can't get switches to work. Oh! That's a great title for another map. Added a little bit more to the map to make it less dull. Moved around the BFG, and added a few cells. Added a Megasphere. Added more unneeded green textures. Everywhere.",
