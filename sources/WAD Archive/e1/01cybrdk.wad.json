	"description": "DOOM 2 DEATHMATCH WAD Small, circular fast paced wad, leading to VERY high frag counts. Equal weapons, and ammo are available to each player, (no king of the hill possible in this wad!!!!!!...). All starting points have at least the Super Shotgun. There are no places to hide, (no camping allowed!!!, ....... frag or get fraged!!!) The exit room is easy to find and identify, (so mistakes of an early exit should not occur, even with some of your Forest Gump type buddies !!!).",
