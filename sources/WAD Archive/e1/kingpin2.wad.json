	"description": "This is a Medium/large level designed for single player.It picks up where Kingpin1 ends. You have successfully annhilated the enemy resistance at Kingpin's Lair,and without time to gather your thoughts you find yourself surrounded by the enemy.You must find the strength to waste any living creature you encounter. Covert operations at Gargoyle's Gorge have us puzzled, but we do know that funds from this activity have provided the means to build an impressive command center to the east of the Gorge.Wipe out as many Humanoids as you can and take all the weapons and ammo you can find.Destroy the two main buildings once the enemy is subdued, then get out alive. Your paycheck will be waiting at our office.",
