	"description": "This is a deathmatch level. We've played it for a few days and fragged each other a million times. Though the WAD is deathmatch only, I didn't just put a few rooms here and there, but also did my usual work of texture choosing and aligning to make it not only play good, but also _look_ good. I've seen too many levels which might be quite playable, if their authors had spent more time on giving them the right look.",
