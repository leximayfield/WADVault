	"description": "Lost in a desert somewhere on a recently colonized planet, you're about to die from thurst. You stumble under the cruel sunlight. Suddenly, in a small depression, you find the entrance to a mining station. Most of the inhabitants seem to have left in a hurry. Some of them even seem to have gone mad with fear and shoot everything in sight. Visiting the derelict buildings you wonder what could possibly have frightened them. Actually after a few moments, you wish you never found out.",
