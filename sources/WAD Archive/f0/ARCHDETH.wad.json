	"description": "This is a great demo (tho a bit too short) recorded in ARCHDETH.WAD. This demo fully demonstrates all of the fueatures of the PWAD, from the vertical walls that can be climbed to the control switches for the archvile trap. You'll even see how to get that plasma rifle while still keeping enough health to actually use the damned thing. You'll also see several different ways to take out the guy in the trap control room as well as a few strategies for saving your ass once your in the control room and the others are gunning for you.",
