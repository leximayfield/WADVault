	"description": "Six Years after the crumbling catastrophe of Hell's invasion overtook the complex in the Northern Sector, a young marine was dispatched to go and clean up the mess that Hell left behind. That young marine was you. You must travel to the Northern Complex for the first time since the invasion and clear out the demons that occupy the area. It's crucial that you reclaim this important stronghold, for it may be one of the last beacons of hope for this war... DISREPAIR 2 is an 11 map episode for GZDoom that expands upon the ideas and themes of my original Secretdoom episode \"Disrepair\" and transforms it into a new expansive world. This mapset features new monster types, new music, new textures, and of course new maps .",
