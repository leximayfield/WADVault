	"description": "This level would have had more, but I had problems with the texture I used (Redwall1, beware), so I gave up and decided to make another level with the remaining ideas (and another texture). Well, basically, this level is another Deathmatch joy, w/ not too many secrets, but plenty of weapons and a few tricks to getting them. Some of the switches on the columns aren't aligned, but in the interest of time, and a new level in the works, I said \"Screw It\"! So, enjoy the level and like the name says, it will become a coffin w/ a lot of bodies in it before long, hehe. Oh, yeah, if you play it co-op you might have a chance at UV setting, heheh.",
