Its based on the premise of making only very short levels that can be completed in just a few min instead of making the more traditional longer levels. Hence why this is PWAD is called \"shortmaps\". -------------------------------------------------- STORY: Its the year 2172, and Barack Obama, now the evil dictator of the world after having made a deal with the devil that granted him immortality, is reigning over the world with his army of demons. However, that is not what made you angry and made you want to kill again. No, its the fact that during Obama's demon invasion of your home he killed your bestest beste friend \"Goldy the Goldfish\", and you decided on that day that the Democrats have been in power for long enough. And thus you grab your pistol and head towards a secret base where you hear Obama is keeping his secret teleporter to hell and that it is from that place where he gets his fresh new demons. You figure that destroying the base is a first step towards getting rid of Obama........",
