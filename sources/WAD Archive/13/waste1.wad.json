	"description": "Ohh happy days, when you destroyed the gate- keeper and saved Earth once again. Another hellish monster met its maker. You were once again the hero and received another bundle of medals. But. Some distant and very secret UAC areas had also been hit by the terrible army of monsters. Especially the processing area of the special nukage which come from the gates when used. This area has been taken over by the freaks from hellcity and needs to be cleared. Some squadrons sent in to retrieve the base has already been wasted and now UAC needs their best man: You. As you might have already figured out this is a facility with a high level of danger. Every- where there are toxic and flameable barrels and nukage which will fry your feet off. Be carefull and save the complex.",
