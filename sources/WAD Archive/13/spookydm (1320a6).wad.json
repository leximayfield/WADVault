	"description": "This is the deathmatch level of the Spooky series. It will probably be the secret level to my Spooky episode. I can't really \"set a mood\" - this level is designed for pure deathmatch (2.0 recommended). It's a medium size, but due to clever circular design coupled with strategic windows, in a 3 or 4 player game you can almost always see an opponent.",
