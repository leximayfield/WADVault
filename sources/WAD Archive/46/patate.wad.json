	"description": "Episode 2, Levels 1 through 8. There's not really any situation.. We just decided we were going to make a brand new episode, I just hope it makes the next \"Complete Doom Accessory CD Volume IV\"! Levels are fun, rather smooth on 386s, and small. Levels: E2M 1,3,4,7,8 by Pith Possum, E2M2 and E2M6 are by Apocalypse, and E2M5 by his bro. Wyvern. *Hint* Get LSD.WAD, other episode by Pith Possum! * YOU ---MUST---- USE DOOM 1.666 or newer!!!! *",
