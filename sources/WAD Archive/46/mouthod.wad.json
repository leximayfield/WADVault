	"description": "A three map mini-wad put together in 3 or 4 days over a few months. You start in hell, fighting from The Mouth of Death before plummeting to Earth and carrying on the fight through a small network of caves and a tech-base. Difficulty steps up a whole rung between each map, although supplies are plentiful enough to get past the challenges presented. Nothing huge or amazing, but a nice few maps to have a quick blast through. Jumping and crouching are turned off as they are un-needed, and this wad is pretty much an old school one.",
