You have just been killed in a mission and were put in your grave, in the grave portal you open your eyes and see yourself in a strange world. Where the hell are you? And why these ugly zombies are attacking you? The answer comes in your mind and you know that you are in Hell Port 666 where the bad guys are sent to hell islands, and these guys want to send you there. Well, never mind, you don`t want to go there. You must find a way to heaven, but just now you must defend yourself!",
