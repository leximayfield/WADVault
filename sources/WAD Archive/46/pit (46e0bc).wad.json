	"description": "This is one of favorite DM levels so I thought I'd show it to a wider audience. In some ways it borrows ideas from the excellent Ledges series, and I've put a lot of thought into the design. The difference is that there is only one way out of the central pit: the lift. This makes for a lot of cat and mouse around the central building.",
