	"description": "This level is designed for DEATHMATCH play. It's a modified E1m1 with some new perks. Look for the chainsaw on the elevator, and some new exits/entrances to the rocket area. As well the slime pits don't cause you damage any longer, and dark areas have been added for added suspense.",
