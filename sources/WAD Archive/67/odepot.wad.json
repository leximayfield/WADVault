	"description": "Sometimes, after a long hard day at work at Office Depot you just want to kill something, particularly the irrate customers and the idiotic Mangement. So we created this EXACT copy of the Office Depot in Fort Worth, Texas on Ridgemar Road so we could vent our frustrations out at the end of the working day. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!!",
