	"description": "If you are tired of complete the 32 levels of Doom II; finished R.J.G. Stark Base and Enigma Town then you have been trained for this. This one is the ultimate multilevel sequel. The new argument?: You have destroyed the Enigma Town menace by touching the Sacred Gems in order to activate the Mystical Transportator. You step on it and a curious travel throught the teleport doesn't lead you to home, but a strange place, a very secret teleporter exit in another dimension. You understand that the job is not finished yet, the ultimate enemy, the insane mastermind of all previous Doom Team's struggles against the disasters is somewhere in this \"world?\" maybe awaiting for you. Now you must begin a quest throught strange passages, bases, castles, etc., terminating all type of insane life form in order to find and destroy RJG Blast. You will face new powerful enemies, new lineage of Hell Knight, The extinct Baron of Hell Spirit, and more. But, you count on great weapons, like the Fire Plasma Gun from Enigma, now more powerful, The new BFG10000, the super-chaingun (more bullets per sec). So can you get stuck off?.",
