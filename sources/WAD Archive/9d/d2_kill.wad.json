	"description": "This is the Doom II conversion of my level KILL_EM.WAD. But unlike most DOOM to DOOM II conversions, I've made lots of changes. The level itself is a medium-sized one, with a main arena, passages, and two smaller rooms, each with some tricks and strategies to them. The courtyard is where I expect much of the major fighting to be carried out, and has three main structures in it, as well as ledges around much of it. The structures are a hollow pillar (with nice stuff inside), a tall thin building (only way to get up it is a lift, so it's great for hiding nice stuff in, hint hint), and a pagoda, who's main function is blocking shots and holding up opponents. Of the smaller rooms, one is pitch-dark, and holds some warp-in spots and guns, and makes for great ambushes. The other room has a jail in it, see the next subject.",
