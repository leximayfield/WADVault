	"description": "I decided to spice up doom by making a Maiden tune collection to use as doom background music. Nobody knows when Melt is out, but with this and doom you should have something of a substitute. (I actually made this wad a couple of weeks ago trying to make Awe64 work with doom95, but thought it might be nice to share it with others now that Virtual XI is being released soon...)",
