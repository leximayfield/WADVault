	"description": ".While I have constructed many maps for DOOM and DOOM II this is the first map that I feel proud enough of to post to the net. It's deathmatch only. Everyone here at my office enjoys it, let me know what you think. I put a few monsters in along with all of the weapons and powerups. Not really intended for Deathmatch II, but you can try. I tried to include some good sniper spots while using varying light levels to make the level more of a hunt and chase style of fighting rather that a free for all such as level seven of DOOM II.",
