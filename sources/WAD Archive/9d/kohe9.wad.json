Some good looking crate. At the start there are two Baron which are much easier to kill then a normal Baron. This is level 9 of a 15 level series Im working on. My aim is to make better levels than my old levels. Im really trying onisley. I tried harder to make an archway as well and it looks okay too. Since level 9 of old Doom 2 was called the pit I wanted to made sure that this level has pit too!. The pit is the exit!",
