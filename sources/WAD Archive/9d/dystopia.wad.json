Anywayz, here is an awesome 3-4 player DeathMatch wad me & Obsidian made up. I made this one up in a week and for my first original wad, it came out damn good. I think it has everything a DeathMatch level should have and a good design, and atmosphere. Thanx to Obsidian for replacing the sky, music, and sounds. Sorry for re-using most of the sounds from the last wad, but we like them so damn much we couldn't resist rehashing them, sorry bout that. Enjoy...",
