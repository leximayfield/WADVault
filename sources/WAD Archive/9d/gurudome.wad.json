	"description": "My first wad for Heretic. Whenever we deathmatched on the original maps, I always felt like a Pacman. We played Doom too much and can't get used to spells. So I constructed this map. It is a very heterogeneous environment but I think it looks good. I meant it to be spell-free and we like it that way. However I placed some spells for the rest of you who like them on skill 4,5 (see below). It was built for deathmatch but I added some monsters for enjoyment of lonely solo players or co-op lovers.",
