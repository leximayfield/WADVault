	"description": "This level is made with rookies and serious Deathmatchers in mind, with varied terrain and viewpoints from which to snipe friends and enemies alike. Conserve ammo, take advantage of cover and concealment and run like hell. More of what the original Scourge.wad was only worse. The carnage involved in acquiring the red key is worth the download alone. (Replaces previous upload of Scourge2.wad to correct goofs)",
