	"description": "Great DEATHMATCH level! Beaucoup de fragging, all the weapons, small sneaky hidey-holes! Watch for 1-way trick walls and teleport strategies. The plasma gun is hard to get, but worth it. :) There's only enough monsters to keep the chickens from hiding. Altdeath (of course) and Respawn are recommended for this wad. You may have an earlier version of this wad. Is so, please trash it, this one's much better. Enjoy.",
