	"description": "Ten maps made during the forty-forth Abyssal Speedmapping Session in the space of 2 hours, with 15 minutes for music and texture selection and 15 minutes for bugfixing. Held in two sessions twelve hours apart, mappers had the mandatory theme of optimistic brutalism, chosen randomly from a list of ten themes. The second session had another theme to choose from, that being teleporter-based traversal, also taken from the list. There were two optional bonus themes in addition to the two mandatory ones, the first being to use one main color for the map, while the second is to make extreme sector height differences. OTEX was required for this session.",
