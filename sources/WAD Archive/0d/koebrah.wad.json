The ammo and gameplay balanse are much better and I also discuvered some new texteres in Doom2 which I decuidad to yuse in this levul, one textere has a pichure of a man with a mistushe on his face and another is a flag like thing which looks really good, like a red cross like flag thing. I hope you like it, should be lotsa FUN!!",
