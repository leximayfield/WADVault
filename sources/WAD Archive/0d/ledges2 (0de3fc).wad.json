	"description": "This patch file is for E1M1. This is the sequal to LEDGES.WAD. It is basically the same as LEDGES.WAD, but it has a different layout, and some new tricks to get the weapons. Again, the level is designed for deathmatch play, and doesnt function well under normal or co-operative mode. The plasma rifle is nicely placed and should cause havoc in your first few matches.",
