	"description": "\"Tower\" is an add-on level for the -registered- version of Heretic by id software. It was created using Waded v1.81R by Matthew Ayres and HEU v1.0b by Josh Martel & Tom Mustaine. This is my first attempt at a level, and was created as a test, and to have something new to play in Deathmatch games. Named for the predominant Tower w/ winding staircase in the first room.. this level basically is a few large rooms with various extras added in. Intended mostly for Deathmatch play, it can also be played in Co-op or single player mode, since there are -many- monsters roaming around. There is also a secret area with transporters to let you appear in various places to startle your opponent. ;) Try flapping your wings when you hit a dead end.. or just keep walking along the walls until ya go through one. Difficulty levels are active, but whatever level you start on... be prepared for an onslaught.",
