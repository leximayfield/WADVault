	"description": "Prepare your eyesight for the cacophony of STARTAN mess. The visual delight you're about to experience matches only botched WADs (or that 50-shades WAD). Expect: paper-thin walls, bent doors, strange shapes, STARTAN, more STARTAN and violation of Romero's \"change floor, change height\" principle. Get yourself inspired by the perfect screen split as you spawn. Get yourself pumped with the pump-action shotgun (but don't forget its double-barrelled brother). Get psyched!",
