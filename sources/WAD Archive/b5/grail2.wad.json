	"description": "Designed for Deathmatch, but as usual I have put a few monsters in. A MEDIEVAL style level. Features include deep water and real 3D floors etc. Sort of a demo of my forthcoming megawad GRAIL QUEST 3D which will hopefully have some new textures and sprites. My aim is to make a sort of medieval equivalent of the mummy phuquers with a knights Templar/holy grail theme but the new textures are taking longer than expected, hence the modified heretic textures.",
