	"description": "This is Episode Two my New Deathmatch levels. In these levels the only weapons you get to use are Chainsaws, pistols, the 2 Shotguns, and a rocket launch once in a while. I think this would be a refreshing chane to the standard DM game. (IMHO) After a few last minute changes CBS Episode 2 is here! Enjoy! (4:20, the time it was finished heh heh. No lie!)",
