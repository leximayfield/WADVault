	"description": "This is a very large wad (about 230k), mainly because of all the detail I put in. I would have released it a lot earlier, but I had to wait for the GCC version of DEU when it got too big. Then, I had to wait for Doom 1.4 when it got too complex. But now I have got everthing finished, and if you run it as described should be no HOMs, etc., unlike some... It will probably run slow in places on less than a DX2, but I had to comprimise for quality. I hope that I have made this level fun to play as well as good to look at, but only you can decide that.",
