	"description": "!!!WARNING!!! Hymers College has been over-run by large bearded monsters from outer P1!!! It all started when an experiment The Moog was doing, went terribly wrong! Mr Woola, who was standing by, got sucked into The Moog's machine and lots of little Mr. Woolas started coming out of it! Then all the Mr. Woolas started to grow, and grew into deadly Mr Woolas who could throw fireballs. They all went on the rampage and ate all the other teachers, now they are very hungry and are looking for a nice tasty morsal. But YOU must rid Hymers of these deadly Woolas before they spread and take over the whole school! Your only aid is a small pistol, who Mr. Swinney kept in his top draw, (just in case.)",
