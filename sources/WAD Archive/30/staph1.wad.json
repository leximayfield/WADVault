	"description": "A set of 6 small, tight deathmatch maps, tested and refined over several hundred games. These maps capture the feel of classic old-school deathmatch. Detailing was done in moderation as not to sacrafice gameplay and level flow. Play with \"vanilla Doom\" settings if possible for the most balanced gameplay.",
