	"description": "This is a wonderful WAD, made for all modes of play. The thing that makes this WAD special is that you will always have enemies to blast. And the longer you're living, the harder the level will get. It's an odd-looking temple that is a square shape. There's weapons and items scattered around the whole place, one of every kind except for a chainsaw.",
