	"description": "My favorite wads have always been the ones that are the most realistic, that is myself skulking with a shotgun. This leval is just that, there are a few rocket shells, but only a couple. The bad guys are mostly former humans and Imps. If you turn a corner, expect someone to try and kill you. Not much secret, but lots of violence. If you are running out of shells, there are probably more right on the other side of the door, try to get around the baddies and get more shells.",
