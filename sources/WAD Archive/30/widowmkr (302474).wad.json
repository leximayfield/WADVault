You enter an otherwise unguarded building a take the elevator to the upper floor. Things seem quiet, soft music is playing and there is a familiar guard outside the elevator door. Hmm, they have changed the decor since the last time you were here. You look over at the Reception Desk, and spot the Imps! Things are going to get tough. But you're the best, heh? Nothing is going to stop you from your mission, not some pesky little Imp! Play it cool, ammo and healing are in short supply (this is corporate life). Monsters abound, and have many places to hide. They may come out to find you, so watch your back.",
