	"description": "Short, Boom (-complevel 9), rocket-centric, slaughter-ish, lightly-puzzle-y-but-not-much- really speedmap I made for an awesome angry cloud's birthday and because I had a funny idea for a layout that was perfect for her birthday. After 2 hours on the first night making most critical things, another hour tweaking gameplay the \"second\" night, and another hour and a half detailing/fixing stuff on the \"third\" night, plus some time getting feedback, I bring you this ~5 hour speedmap :) UV will kill you a few times; HMP is a much easier, more casual experience and HNTR more-so from there. Good luck and have fun! Midi \"Heart of the Sun\" comes from an improv Joe Satriani did for a guitar magazine. Demo1 in 0:59 by rdwpa; Demo2 and 3 by me.",
