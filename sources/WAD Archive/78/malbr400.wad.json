	"description": "You know aluac400.wad? I made a version where you can ACTUALLY BEAT IT. But for those who haven't played aluac400... This is a hyper-boss based on Albert Four-Hundred from Sights of Agony, a Terry WAD made by Ogre. It is very hard to defeat and is made to have the likeness of the Unmasked Mediel boss fight from \"Claustrophobia: The Walls Close In\". I love that WAD, and it is one of the few non-Terry WADs that I enjoy. So hunch over your keyboard, and hope that your computer doesn't die from this.",
