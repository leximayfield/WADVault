	"description": "This is my 1st WAD so please don't flame me if you don't like it. This WAD is a replacement for E1M1. Maybe some of you will find it too big to be played in deathmatch but I think it should be funny the same !. Originally it was full of barrels,decorations and other nice things but when I tried to save a game DOOM crashed. So I had to delete hundreds of these decorations (sigh !) in order for DOOM to save a game correctly ..... sorry .....You still can't save with DOOM 1.2",
