	"description": "Collection with four of my own deathmatch levels. Health is sparse on all of them. Meaning lots of frags and a hopefully a short life for everyone. This levels have been developed, tested and adjusted to be fun for deathmatch. They work best with 3 or 4 players. There are no secrets, but you might want to take a look with your favourite DOOM-editor to get hold of the trigger lines.",
