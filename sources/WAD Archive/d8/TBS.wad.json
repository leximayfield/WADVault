	"description": "This is a wad file of my place of employment. We have a few rather dedicated network DOOM players. This is a large map with several secrets. There is also one place where you can become trapped, but don't worry, you will soon die. Play this on difficulty 1 or 2 and there are no monsters, great for deathmatch. Difficulty 3 and 4 have monsters, 4 has many monsters. Enjoy.",
