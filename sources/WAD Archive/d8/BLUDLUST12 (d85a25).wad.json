	"description": "This level was originally designed as a death match level. For 2 players the deathmatches tend to be more stealthy with lots of hunting. With four players, it is a wild romp of death, destruction, and well, BLOODLUST!!!! >^]__ _ _| It is relatively difficult. If you try to get 100% kills, you WILL need to conserve ammo. I've seen it beaten with one shell and zero shells left!!! This is my first from scratch level (ooh!! a disclaimer!!)",
