	"description": "My second huge effort. This one has many stairways and lifts for a more 3-D feel. Also, alot of puzzles to figure out. Good for Deathmatch as you can get thru all areas in both directions. Hint- To git the Rocket Launcher you must do a \"U\"-Turn. Dedicated to Computer Users of Erie so don't forget to look at the auto-map before ending the level. This DooM 2 wad was converted from a DooM 1 wad with DooM 2 monsters added for more blasting enjoyment.",
