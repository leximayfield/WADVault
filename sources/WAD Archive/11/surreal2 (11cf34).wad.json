	"description": "This is a re-release of Surreal2.wad, it includes some minor changes such as texture re-alignments, texture improvements, and one new texture. Surreal2.wad is designed to look and feel different from a standard ID wad. It includes a 360 night time sky with clouds and moons, waterfalls you can hear, a trap you can \"defuse\", a highway, and other even cooler stuff. This is a PWAD only and requires no changes to the Doom exe.",
