	"description": "My \"HANGAR\" has two hangars and is considerably harder than E1M1. (Original DOOM.) This whole level has no story, it is pure creativity. Any idea that popped into my head went into that PWAD, whether or not it related to the airport scene. It took a very long time to finish this PWAD, and I expect some major revisions. Thank God for DEU II.",
