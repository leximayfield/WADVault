	"description": "Deathtag in a Port bass! Damn, this wad took me long to make.. well, for starters, i had to master the deep water/false floor effect..hard.. Then i had to learn how to make this wad capatable with DEATHMATCH. I have a feeling this wad will be played alot. well i hope.. this took me long enough.. after doing this wad i feel like never making one again.. but then, that's a lie.. P.S. toward the begining of school i became too anctious and stoped aligning textures.. don't worry.. it's only a few. PLEASE READ WRULES.TXT!! _______________________________________________",
