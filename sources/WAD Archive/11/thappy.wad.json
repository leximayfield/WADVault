It has all of the guns except the Rocket Launcher and BFG, which would be way too unfair in a level this small. Believe me, you will get a WHOLE LOT of frags with three or four players! Happy DeathMatching!!!! :-) **Oh, and to see a cool two player DeathMatch between me and Veg-Man just wait a few seconds after you load up DOOM2 in single play to watch the demo. **",
