	"description": "Peanut Butter Cake Massacre is another sequel to Oreo Cake Massacre. This one has a lot of white, tan, and brown. Peanut butter is golden brown but I could not find a shawn texture that resembles that color so I had to use tan as a substitute. This level has some invisible items so you are going to have to do some hunting around for them.",
