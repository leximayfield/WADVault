	"description": "A deathmatch level that has been tested in 2 player and works great! It should be pretty good for 3 or 4 player as well, but if someone gets 3 or 4 player going send me a demo. Thanks. In the middle of the ring, there's a special effect that I don't think has ever been used before: a reflective marble floor! Check it out. Not much emphasis on the BFG here - as I'm not very big on that weapon.",
