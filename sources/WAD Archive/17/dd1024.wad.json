	"description": "An small mapset containing 7 maps in total I made for Lutrov's 1024 contest. All maps are playable from pistol start, or play through them in one go its up to you. Ive really enjoyed making these maps and I hope you will enjoy playing them. UV is pretty tough so you might want to choose an lower skill level first its very easy on skill 1/2. I hope you will like map07 on UV from pistol start :) its hard but you can beat it.",
