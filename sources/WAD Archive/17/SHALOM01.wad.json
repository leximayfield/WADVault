	"description": "UAC Outpost Nine has been invaded by alien lifeforms. A reconnaissance squad of ten has been sent in to assess the situation and secure the outpost. The squad leader reported that the outpost personnel had been killed, and were perhaps cloned for alien soldiers. The last contact with the squad leader was a request for reinforcements -- losing assets fast! Have not had contact in twenty-four hours. Since all divisions have been committed to the ongoing battle for the Earth, we're forced to turn to you. But, since you're stationed at HQ, we can only arm you with your sidearm. But hey, you're trained Marine, with combat experience -- besides, haven't you bitched about your desk job long enough?",
