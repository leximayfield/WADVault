	"description": "Welcome to 2048 UNLEASHED - An all new 32 level single player megawad for DOOM 2 put together by various authors in the community. Known as the Pcorf Community Project 2 at the Doomworld forums. The aim of this project was simple and it was to create a 2048x2048 Boom compatible level for DOOM 2 using the Whispers of Satan texture wad. 10 months later I received 49 levels divided into two episodes, the first 2048 UNLEASHED which contains the 32 main levels and the second ALL HOPE FOR PEACE which contains 17 additional levels.",
