	"description": "TRIO - an ultimate DooM II DM experience! The game begins at a medium pace with \"Fragging\", where hunting down your enemy is THE key to success. All weapons are present, but the bigger guns are harder to find! The DeathMatch then proceeds to a frantic pace with \"Gnash\", a small WAD pumped with adrenalin. Success is based on skill and anticipation. The BFG is present, but getting it leaves you vulnerable... The pace lessens just a little for the final level, \"Peace\" - a true classic! This total test of strategy is a mind game, where the aim is to control the match using rockets AND access to the MegaSphere! There are many dark places to hide, so you can ambush the enemy. Force your opponent to take desperate measures with a systematic massacre, and watch your frag count jump! These WADs provide a good cross-section of DooM II DeathMatch levels. It provides hours of FRENZIED, FRAGGING FUN! (I guess that's a bit of a clich? in the DooM world now...)",
