	"description": "Deathmatch WAD with some twists. Lots of places to Score a TELE-FRAG. There are a couple of places where there are small \"Fence posts\" right by a tele-pad. If you are standing by one and it drops, it means someone has just crossed the entry to the BFG room. If you jump on the tele-pad right away, you can score a TELE-FRAG. This level is INTENSE with four players.",
