	"description": "Another Doom 2 deathmatch wad. But a good one. All the weapons, and a nasty surprise for naive players. I'll tell you where a secret switch is, but don't tell fellow players. No i won't tell you, i'll show you, watch the demo. It reveals large quantities of nasty things, like FOUR cyberdemons, MANY of those skeleton things that shoot homing rockets, MORE THAN A FEW arachnotrons (i kan't spel), and SEVERAL other things. ALSO, additional items are revealed, like soulspheres, backpacks, lite amp GOGGLES! and other stuff. So after all the monsters are wiped out, deathmatch can resume under altered conditions!!!",
