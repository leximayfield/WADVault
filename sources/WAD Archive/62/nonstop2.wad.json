	"description": "This is another wad based on the SUPERB theme of a wad called \"gore1.wad\" (I didn't make that), which means: 4 weapons at the start, NO health, NO armor, NO extra ammo, NO Invulnerabilities and other disturbing this. Basically, all is stripped down to what it oughta be: KILL, KILL, KILL!!!!! To make it even funnier, there's a Hell Knight in a little pit in the middle, where you can kill yourself without getting a minus frag! Cute, eh? I hope you enjoy it! (If you do, download the nonstop.wad too, it's almost even better than this!)",
