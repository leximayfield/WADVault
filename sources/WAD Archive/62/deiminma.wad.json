	"description": "Episode 2 themed techbase level without hell's corruption, hence the name \"immaculated\" I've tried to emulate the great work of Tom Hall and Sandy Petersen in shores of hell with a personal touch. I've always thought that fortress of mistery was just plain hell and I've felt the need of making an apropriate secret level for shores of hell following its theme. In desing map10, refueling base of Doom II would have fit very well as a E2M9 level if they wouldn't have rejected and reused it for Doom II This is a true E2 level, with lots of ick, shawn, compohso, cement and vine textures and it has an organic and non linear desing as well as a good interconnection.",
