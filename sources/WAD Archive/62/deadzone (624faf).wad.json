	"description": "\"Dead Zone\" is a new episode that replaces Episode 2 (just because of the music and sky). This is my first single-player episode and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it. Map 1 - Outpost Map 2 - Recieving Map 3 - Server Bank Map 4 - The Spiral Map 5 - Dead Zone Map 6 - The Sewers Map 7 - Power Plant Map 8 - Gateway to Earth Map 9 - Teleporter Research Probably a little short but time wasn't my concern. I played through it and it seems to flow nicely. Map 3 isn't as serious as the others just because I wanted it to go with the music (Doom 3 inspired it). Also, in map 9, shoot the brown-metal line in the Cacodemon room to lower a teleporter. Don't jump into the pit because you can't escape it.",
