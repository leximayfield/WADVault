	"description": "A rather large level with lotsa everything. It is my first wad but don't be fooled. I have put many long hours into it. So much so that I decided that I would upload it now in fear that it would never be released. Don't get me wrong. I know of NO ERRORS or any sort. Anyway, you have three of keys/doors present each is different. One level is an exact duplicate of a level from Under World II. The others your have have to find out for yourself. Almost every hidden door/etc. has been indicated by an odd colour something or other or an offset brick/whatever.",
