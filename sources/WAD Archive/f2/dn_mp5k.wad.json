	"description": "This replaces the chaingun with a MP5K sub-machine gun. The original gun graphics are taken from the MP5K weapon add-on for Duke Nukem 3D by Ian Jones. I had to modify the sprites a little, but it turned out okay. I got the icon for the weapon from Dt-uzi by Don Tello. This >should< work with Doom, Doom II, and any Doom port. I recommend getting Smack My Marine Up for this patch, because of it's cool-ass cross hair.",
