	"description": "I started out intending to make this a DeathMatchWAD, but it kept growing on me, until I decided to go all out and just make it as big as I could. It actually was bigger at one time, but I kept getting errors and was unable to save games, so I scaled it back. I really wish I could have more monsters in the wad, but it crashes if I put in any more.",
