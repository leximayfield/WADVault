	"description": "Extended Hell is a more extended version of Hell's Ambiance, which the songs used are longer and likely makes the tension factor go up. This features music by Jaxxoon R (Dark Ambient Pack on /idgames/), Kevin MacLeod and Purple Planet's royalty free tracks with the latter two modified to give the \"Extended\" tone. This replaces both Doom and Doom 2 music if using ZDoom or GZDoom, but only Doom 2 for Zandronum. (See 'Bugs' for workaround)",
