	"description": "The research station on Sirius 4 has not been responding to recent communications - ever since they reported a breakthrough on an ancient culture that is living there. They had found the beings that these creatures worshipped... It would take too long to send a ship there, but they can rig the teleporter to send a single person to the station (with a simultaneous loss of power for 200 kms in every direction) to scout the situation. Congratulations. You got the job.",
