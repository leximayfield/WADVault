	"description": "Its the annual buzzsaw festival, need I say more. A great way to relieve stress. Can be used as single player with monsters or as a deathmatch. For best results either ban the use of the pistol or use a hack to give the players no bullets. This wad probably works better in deathmatch2. Happy hacking, slashing, cutting, chopping.",
