	"description": "It's a simple DECORATE joke weapon patch that replaces the BFG9000 with a suicide bomber vest. You press the button and BOOM! You're a goner along with anyone else near by. I got the idea to make this from playing Ghoul's Forest 2. If you find this offensive, I apologize for this.",
