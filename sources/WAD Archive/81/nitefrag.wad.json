	"description": "This is my third DOOM wad and I named it NITEFRAG because of the dark courtyard and the new night sky. This is a small to medium-sized wad consisting of a big building, a small building, two platforms and a courtyard with a ledge around it. I took a hell of a long time aligning the textures. This wad has a good visual appeal and I am a firm believer that if you don't at least try to align the damn textures then you should stop sending out wads! It costs people time and money to download this stuff so spend the extra time and make your Pwad look good before uploading it!",
