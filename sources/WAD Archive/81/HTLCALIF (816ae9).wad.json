	"description": "Well, no one knows what the real Hotel California looks like so I took a chance. It reminds of the lyrics in the song \"you can check in,but you will never check out. There are lots of hiding places in the bedrooms that you can see out but the other players can't see in, but watch out they can shoot you.Watch out for the lava pit, and the sublight in the bathroom.Made primarily for Deathmatch, one player is kind of short. We're all DOOMED. tom",
