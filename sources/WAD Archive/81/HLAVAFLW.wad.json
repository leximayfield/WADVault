	"description": "This level has been tested on a 486 SX2 40 and a 486 DX2 66. All levels of difficulty play accordingly. This wad is tough on ultra violent, but is completable without cheating. If you die a lot, which you will, then try a different approach. Save your game often. This level is most exciting on ultra violent. A hint about the exit, you will require wings. *** GOOD LUCK ***",
