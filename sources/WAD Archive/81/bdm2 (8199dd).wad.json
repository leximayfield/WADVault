	"description": "This is a wad designed for death match but is also fun in single player. It is a half outside, half inside level. I think it came out pretty damn good, Give it a look! All the weapons are there. In single player there are gobs of baddies but plenty of amo. It ain't too big, ain't too small... it's just right:)",
