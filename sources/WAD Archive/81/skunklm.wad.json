	"description": "Doomguy had one job: eliminate all the demons from Earth, which he completed successfully over 20 years ago. Now it's time to go to the convenience store and get some cat food, because his cat is hungry and Doomguy wants a Crunch bar. As Doomguy is walking towards the store, the road crumbles beneath his feet and he falls into the sewer! \"I'll bet those damn demons are behind this!!\" he screams, tumbling down into the cavity below. Doomguy will get to the convenience store, even if a small portion of hell stands in his way!",
