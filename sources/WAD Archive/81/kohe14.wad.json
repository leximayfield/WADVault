	"description": "In the Kohe13 text file I accidently put MAP13 as the map while it should have been MAP03 thats because Kohe3 was MAP13 so Kohe13 had to be MAP03 sorry all those other players out there. In Kohe14, you are in the second to last mission in the Kohe trilogy and you are in for a huge challenge. You face the Fat Slobs, and the Arch Men can easily be disturbed. Finding the key to the exit is simple, just think where it is. Dont feel a sorry if you beat cant level.",
