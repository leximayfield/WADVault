	"description": "So, have you ever been annoyed how so many monsters reuse sound effects, and how a few of them have no sounds to call their own? Tired of Revenants making the same old \"DEEU-EEUH\" sounds when shot instead of a suitably skeletony shriek? How about that naughty Archvile, and his distinct lack of sounds in the PSX version's style? Well now you're in luck! With the magic of a little SNDINFO, Audacity, and some sounds I had lying around, anything is possible! (For PSX fans at least!)",
