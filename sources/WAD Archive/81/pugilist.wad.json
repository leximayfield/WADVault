	"description": "First level is a fairly small entry-level type wad, but quite detailed. Recommended for experienced players (although full skill-level support has been provided). Second level is a command-center type level, with a lot of themes (sentry posts, dungeon, mechanical room, supply and storage room, waste storage area, barracks, officer's dining room, toilets, and of course computer centers). Third level is a mostly outdoor level, with arena-type areas and interesting architectural elements. You get to meet the big boys in this level; use them to your advantage. Quite challenging on Ultra Violent skill level (but fun, I hope). Read the accompanying story (story.txt) for more details. This file has all three parts of a 3-level series that fits the story line. Several puzzles, but none too fiendish.",
