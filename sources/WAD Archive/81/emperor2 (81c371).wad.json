	"description": "My second completed, glitch-free wad. If you get easily aggravated when you have to take a little time finding switches and keys, steer clear. This WAD was designed as a companion to be played with emperor1.wad. As a result, it is slated in map02. However, those wishing to play it alone (and there's no reason why you can't) can use the emp2.bat file to warp directly to the level.",
