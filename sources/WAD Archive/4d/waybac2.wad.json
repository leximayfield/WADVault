	"description": "My intention with my second level was to construct a level that is reasonably challenging to complete, but withoout tossing 20 monsters in each room. But, I did assume that you don't cheat! <g> Otherwise, the level will probably be too easy to complete. Chose your weapons carefully, meter your ammo, and stay on your toes! Most rooms have a \"trick\" for making it through mostly unscathed, but can take a few passes to figure out the best strategy to escape with the fewest scars.",
