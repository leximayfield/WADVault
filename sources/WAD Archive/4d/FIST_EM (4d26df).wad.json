	"description": "This is a fairly large level geared toward 3 or more players. Not many monsters but plenty of ammo. Lots of open space with some good sniper spots. Yes I have two prisons ( HALLS ) but one is escapable. I might of gotten lazy with a couple of unpegged textures but I had so many new ideas for new wads, that I had to put this behind me. Lots of lifts and teleports ( or transports for all the Trekkies ). I named it \" Fist_Em \" because when you are out of ammo, there is nothing better than sneaking up on someone ( who is armed for bear ) and punching their lights out.",
