	"description": "You were sitting down, in your home, just recovering from the battle you had with the Spider Mastermind at the end of Doom I. Suddenly, the lights in your room starting flashing. The TV screen was covered with static noise, and you could hear electricity sparking all over you. There was a green flash, and you appeared back on the moon. You stand there amazed, thinking that you had destroyed everything on your last visit. You'd heard tales of this place from your friends that lay before you, dead. If only you believed what they said, then perhaps you could have saved them. Too late now, but don't leave all this for someone else to clean up, you must do it NOW.",
