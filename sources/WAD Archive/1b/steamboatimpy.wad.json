	"description": "It is a rather small map, my first one, that i made to test my skills and familiarize with the GZDoom builder. I always wanted something steampunk'ish to play, so this is a small cargo steamship teleported into a hellish dimension and now full of demons and former crew members (roughly sixty monsters-full). It needs GZDoom and Doom 2 to play. Any criticism is appreciated - maybe i'll make something better next time.",
