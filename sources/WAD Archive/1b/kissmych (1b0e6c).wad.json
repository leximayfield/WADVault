	"description": "This one should be good for a change. So many PWADs I've seen look like they've been thrown together in a couple hours. Dark circular arena with large spiral staircase in center under main skylight. Various concentric corridors, rooms, and lifts at different heights and vantage points. Detailed texture mapping and original architecture. When I put the monsters in, they looked right at home! Especially that sun- sucking, fire-wielding Arch-vile and those sniper- like heat-seeking missile-launching Revenants!",
