	"description": "THE STORY SO FAR: You've been knocked unconcious, and are in a sealed room in which you think you ran to right before you were struck but don't know. You wake to see you are in a room in which the walls are bleed- ing, and see a window in front of you and see some strange aliens through it. Now you know how you were knocked out and it's all coming back to you now. Aliens landed on your base and started taking it over. You were running for the sealed room so you would be safe. (actually it was an armory, but now all thats left is a shotgun) You remember there is a teleporter at the far west side of your base which will take you to another, hopefully safer base. You get brave and open the sealed door only to be supprised by some trapped aliens, no problem cause you knock them of easily. As you continue to wander you think ((((Where are the rest of my comrads??))))..........GET OUT!",
