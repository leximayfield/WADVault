	"description": "Many strange things has occurred on the USS Voyager, but never has it met a greater threat than now. Life is ordinary on the ship and everybody are doing their normal duties. Chakotay is meditating and Paris and Torres are having a quarrel about some silly game on the holodeck. They receive an emergency call on the secret channel. Janeway \"On sreen\" and the entire bridge freezes in horror.They are met with a disgusting sight; a beast, a monster nothing like they have ever seen before. \"You have five minuts to abandon the ship. Should any remain, are they never to see the stars again through their own vulgar eyes. The ship is mine.\" Voyager chooses to fight, but are slaughtered within minuts. Many escapes, including our well known officers, but the loss is beyond imagination. Alone in a corridor you hear distant roars and screams of pain. You are the only one left. Not an officer and certainly not a gentleman. You know that the ship will pass a Vulcan outpost on a class M planet within transporter range. Fight your way through a futuristic version of hell and get to the transporter room to call for help.",
