	"description": "A hard, castle type level, but NOT insanely hard, it can be beaten in UV without findig the secrets, (but you probably be tight of ammo the first time) I made this in the spirit of the original Doom levels (that means no jumping/crouching are needed), so it doesn't use any port-specific features. It also seems to be a nice deathmatch level (only been tested with SKulltag bots).",
