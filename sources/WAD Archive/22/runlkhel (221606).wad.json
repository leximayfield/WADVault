	"description": "My first WAD. Designed for single player, multiple player or Deathmatch modes, easy, medium or hard. Looks much like a Castle, complete with moats, dungeons, secret passages, temples, and even an open pit mine where they obviously got all of that green marble (and there is a lot of green marble).",
