	"description": "After kicking a messenger into a well, scouts report to you that an army of Persians 10,000,000,000,000 strong marches towards the gates of Sparta. If even one Persian breaches the (open) gate, all is lost. The Ephors have consulted the Oracle and have given you their blessings to go to war. You hope to push your way through the hordes of Persians and destroy their leader Xerxes, thus stopping the invasion. Your ranks, which numbered a mere 300 men, have thinned due to syphilis contracted during battle with the Mud Giants to the North. You are the only one left. May the Gods have mercy.",
