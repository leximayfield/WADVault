	"description": "A humble pack of Heretic cooperative levels. The goal was to make monster massacre maps with infinite ammo in a short development period. Thankfully, Heretic puts a fresh spin on things if you are weary of lawnmower Doom coop levels. Weapons and monsters have been tweaked a bit from their standard behavior to make the game more entertaining.",
