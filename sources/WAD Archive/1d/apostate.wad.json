	"description": "An Episode 3 replacement for HERETIC. The episode is laid out so that levels 1-3 are inspired by E1, levels 4, 9, and 5 by E2, and levels 6-8 by E3. Expect a boss fight every 3rd level. I tried to make the difficulty progress nicely so that the beginning is easy but by the end you'll be given some tough fights. I also tried to balance ammo so that each level could be completed from \"elvenwand start\".",
