	"description": "This is my first megawad Illuminatus. It took me a while to get the full version out due to problems with the beta testing as well as some personal things, but now I finally got the full official version out. I did release a beta of the Doom WAD, but it wasn't finished as it also had many problems. In the future, I might update this WAD with bug fixes when it comes to playing this WAD with DOSBox and classic source ports. I do hope you all enjoy this megawad.",
