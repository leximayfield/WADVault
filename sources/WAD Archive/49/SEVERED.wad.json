	"description": "This is my first attempt at something like this. I've made maps before, but never tried publishing them. The only map in this replaces the first map of Doom 2. I plan to make six more maps to follow this one for a campaign, but I needed feedback for the direction I was going in. Jumping and free-aiming play sort of a big part and there are deepwater segments and line defs that spawn monsters. Tried to make use of some of the neat Skulltag/zDoom engine features. This map maybe takes about 8 minutes to complete after fully exploring everything. There is a secret level exit, but when activated, you're given an on screen message that the level is not made yet (no crashing or anything :))",
