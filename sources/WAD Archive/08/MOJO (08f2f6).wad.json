	"description": "MOJO is for DEATH MATCH!!! Straight forward smash-mouth design in the spirit of FLENZERZ.WAD and HUNTED.WAD I always leave out that annoying CLAW so don't look for it!!! MOJO has been heavily play-tested and is ready for the pros... All my wads are \"NOT\" recomended for beginners. It takes a keen eye and a steady hand...You gotta know those key strokes 'caus this aint that runninaround shoot anything that moves DOOM thing, it takes a little more brain work and coordination... None of my wads are for people who like to hide so get out there and fight!!! <evil grin> I bought HERETIC for modem play and I design for death match so those predictable little monsters are only in there for target and manuver practice!",
