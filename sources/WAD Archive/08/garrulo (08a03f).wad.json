	"description": "A complete episode for Doom2, with all 32 maps replaced... I think that these are quality levels: cool architecture, good light effects, studied use of textures... And I hope, with a exciting gameplay! The two guys that appears in the main screen are Chiquito de la Calzada -\"Child of the Road\" (!!!), spanish humorist-, and El Fary -\"The Fary\", matchless spanish singer, like Frank Sinatra, Bob Dylan or other international stars (!!!)-.",
