	"description": "A fortress full of enemies with a wide open area just in front of it. I wouldn't run it on a machine with a CPU slower than a P166; the level is quite huge and a test on a 486/66 showed the limits of that CPU... Use an advanced engine (like ZDoom, Legacy or BOOM) to enjoy the level at best, but please remember to disable the jump feature...",
