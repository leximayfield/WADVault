	"description": "Scattered Ashes is a 10-level wad made in 3 weeks as a part of the NaNoWADMo 2018 project. Each level takes about 5 minutes to play through. The gameplay is pretty standard in some maps, but it can get quite gimmicky in others, so there's a bit of variety in terms of that. The wad is split into 2 episodes. One centers around the colors gray and black, the other around green. Freelook is recommended.",
