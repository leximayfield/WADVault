	"description": "A medieval style level with lots of green and a couple of huge rooms (check out the pentagram in the shrine room!). It's not one of those gigantic, brain bending levels, but I paid special attention to textures (just a few misaligned spots), light levels, sector heights, hidden doors, etc. to stick to the basic theme, maintain realism, and enhance the experience.",
