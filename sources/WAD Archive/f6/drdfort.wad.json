	"description": "Inspired by Lachlan Stewart's excellent \"Dandy3\" level. In it, I discovered the joys of crossfire, plus I've had this general layout floating around in the noggin for a while. Plenty of action and lots o' strategy. Weapons are abundant and their locations vital to some of the more subtle strategies involved. I'm semi-retired from .WAD making, so I took no steps to align any textures. If this just totally spoils the level for you, so be it, but I don't have the time anymore to devote to making these things. Unless of course, you want to pay me... ;)",
