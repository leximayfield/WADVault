	"description": "I named it VAMPIRE5 because...catchy name! Better than FRODO5, my handle. Anyways. This was made w/ DeathMatch in mind. About half the time making this was spent playing it to make sure everything looked nice. I wanted an artistic PWAD as well as a fun one. Most of the rooms were done on paper first. Much time has been spent thinking about how things will be placed and if they'll \"work well\" there. Story: trapped in Count Frodo's castle, you must escape the evil vampire's traps and make it out alive. His creatures will try and stop you from escaping. Can you find Count Frodo's secret teleport room? Can you master the Plus Sign?? Can you find the hidden weapon in the Infinity room? Discover all the great snipe spots!",
