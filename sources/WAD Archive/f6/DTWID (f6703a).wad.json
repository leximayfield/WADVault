	"description": "\"At some point in time I got the idea that it would be really fun if John Romero dusted off the ol' doom editor and made another map for Doom episode 1 for old time's sake. He once replied to an email saying 'maybe I will!' but never did get around to it as far as I know. This project asks the contributors to carefully study the original maps and try to make them as John Romero and Sandy Petersen did.",
