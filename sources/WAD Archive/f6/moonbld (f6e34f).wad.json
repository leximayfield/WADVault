	"description": "Moonblood is a megawad (32 levels) for Doom 2. The Project has started with remastering the levels from my first wad, Eclipse, but the changes became quite big and I decided to turn it into Moonblood (it was initially called Revclipse, then after Reclipse). The levels were most inspired by early Scythe 1 levels, Jenesis, Mano Laikas and DTWID series.",
