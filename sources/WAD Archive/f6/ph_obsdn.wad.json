	"description": "A 7-hour speed map for Obsidian's birthday, mapped entirely on the 32-grid (aside from thing placement) which uses the STONGARG gargoyle patch from Doom, the brown rocks from Quake and a squashed (both vertically and into the palette) version of the second hell sky from Doom 3. You start in a little cave and work your way round to the exit on the other side of little valley - pretty simple little map, but that's what you get in a speed map!",
