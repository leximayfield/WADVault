	"description": "This multi-purpose WAD is simply several large sections linked together with a secret underground passageway and a large maze. It promises to be an enjoyable Deathmatch level, with an abundance of weapons and power-ups. Anyway, there's no main theme to this WAD, so just go ahead and play it!",
