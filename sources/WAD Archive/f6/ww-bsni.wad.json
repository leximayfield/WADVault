	"description": "I always liked the original \"Batteries Not : Included,\" not just for its concept (energy : weapons only) but also for the unique designs : that I had come up with for the weapons. That : being said, I also had lots of glaring issues : that needed to be corrected. I originally : intended to port the mod to ZDoom and correct : those issues, but since ZDoom currently (as of : this writing, I've been disconnected for a week) : lacks custom pain states, it's difficult to port. : So instead, I made a sequel. New weapons, : expansions on old weapons, new ideas, and : graphics that don't suck.",
