	"description": "In this new and exciting deathmatch-Pwad you'll find no cross at all. It's called cross because of the huge cross in the open-air-arena I wanted to design, but with ver <1.9 the whole level HOMs all around, so I left it out. But - guess what - without this cross the DM-playing still works and is still mutch fun. Perhaps this Pwad is a little to big for two players, so... (Try out: THOS_02.wad, STAIRS.wad, LIFT.wad, CYRC.wad, RALLE.wad, ASYM.wad and all the other Pwads I've created...)",
