	"description": "Just another deathmatch level, one of my better maps I play in with my friends. The first of a series of 5 maps.. The other four are still in the works. This is the 23rd revision of this map. It is intended to be fast-paced, because you can see practically anywhere on the map from anywhere else, yet it is not a big square. BFG was meant to be tough to get, and I believe it is. Obtaining the plasma is moderately hard, if you can dodge somewhat and the rest of the weapons are spread in good balance. A few monsters thrown in for a twist. Fun to blow people up when they are fighting the chaingunner!",
