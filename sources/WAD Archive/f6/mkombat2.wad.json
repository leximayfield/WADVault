	"description": "It's Mortal Kombat Doom. This patch is old and obsolete. I haven't done any real work on it in almost two years (Today being 2/2/99). I didn't even bother to give Akuma some real walking or death frames or add more blood like I was going to. This patch just isn't worth finishing. I made the level back when I couldn't even align textures. Well give this patch a try if you want. I'll probably use the few good ideas for other patches.",
