	"description": "A compilation of old vanilla maps by myself, most of them unreleased for the archives. I made many changes and fixes, but I tried to keep the classic feeling, although some are heavily modified. All maps are playable from pistol start, but ammo may be tight sometimes. You'll need a limit-removing sopurce-port. Maps were tested with Zdoom and PrBoom. Vavoom ruins especial effects made with game bugs. But you should NOT jump or crouch in this levels.",
