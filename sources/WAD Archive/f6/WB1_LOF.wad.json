	"description": "This is a pure deathmatch level. This is my first level so don't expect much. I tried to cover most of the good aspects of DOOM as best I could. All I can say is there is always a way out of every corner, so don't give up. There aren't many mosters so playing it on single player isn't too fun, but I did have some fun with the teleporters. There is a way out of every situation. Please E-Mail me and let me know what you think. Oh ya...and enjoy!",
