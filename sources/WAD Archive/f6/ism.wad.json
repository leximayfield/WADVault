There are rumours that the Icon is in fact man-sized and uses machinery in this house to change to it's size to the more 'well-known' bulk. It would be nice if you could find this machine and trash it (have a go in it first if you find it.. go on!) Good luck. Beware that this level is a paradox! And don't be too greedy at the end!!",
