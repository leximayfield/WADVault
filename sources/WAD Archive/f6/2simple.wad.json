	"description": "Basically, my friends and I spend hours playing DM on MAP07 in Doom ][, so I decided I'd make a wad in the likeness of said level. Though I never really took much time analyzing the level, I took the basic shape, and worked from there. I mean this to be a DM WAD, but you can play it co-op, and single playerly (though each of above suck). One word of advise, if you don't like plasma, don't get this WAD.",
