	"description": "A first attempt to try out building a short 3 level wad. There is many custom enemies, as well as weapons. This is a good for someone who is an average player, not too hard to too easy. I spent a good chunk researching how to make enemies, and it turned out fine. Your goal is to sort hell out of town, simple right? not so much, there is a monstrous Dragon waiting for you.",
