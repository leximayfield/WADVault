	"description": "This is a wad designed for death match but it seems more fun in single player. It is a half outside, half inside level. I think it came out pretty damn good, Give it a look! All the weapons are there but not keys. In single player there are gobs of baddies but plenty of amo. This is a fixed version of bdm2.wad, just a little different, and no visplane error. (though only one person found the bug before)",
