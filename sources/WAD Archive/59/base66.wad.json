	"description": "This is my second level made from scratch! You're stranded in a military base on Phobos, your mission is to get out alive and destroy the Spider Boss. This level contains a section in which you must activate some switches to open the doors that lead outside where the blue key is found. The last section contains the big Spider Boss!. If your quick enough you can, 1) Sneak by him and finish the level or 2) Grab the BFG 9000 and blast him, or 3) Make him fight with two Barons of Hell and watch them kill each other. Level contains many lifts, and two very high elevators. Enjoy!",
