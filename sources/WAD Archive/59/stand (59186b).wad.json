	"description": "BTW: THIS WAD IS FOR DOOM 2 This wad is based on HEADLONG.WAD but I made many improvements and I think you'll find it's quite different. It's got (as far as I know) every weapon in the game and is intended for deathmatch with no monsters (only way to play!). I did add co-op starts and some monsters but I didn't spend much time on that. I took advantage of some of the new textures from Doom 2 such as the panelling and bookshelves. The exit is easy to reach and very visible because I expect in deathmatch it will make it easier for you. (why bother with co-op exits? :) Anyway, I can't think of anything else to say, except maybe that if you're wondering where I got the name , it's from the best book of all time, `The Stand' by Stephen King and it seemed as good a name as any! :)",
