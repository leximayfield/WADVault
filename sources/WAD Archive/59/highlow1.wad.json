	"description": "I wouldn't exactly state this as a come-back wad as the quality isn't really up to par with my previous work. However, I just hope people will accept this map as a good small to medium sized episode 1 map and nothing more. While it has a distinct episode 1 feel, it doesn't follow the same strict rules as my CH Retro Episode maps. So you might just bump into a cacodemon or two.",
