	"description": "You and four of your buddies got captured. You are now in a prison cell and have to escape! Green has already bested a guard and is now loose. But! Your buddies are still in thier cells! Some of them may have already been killed. (5-number of players, one is ALWAYS dead.) The doors are opened from the room to the south. You still have to work your way around the level, but watch your back! It takes two to end the level in coop. You can do it by yourself in single player.",
