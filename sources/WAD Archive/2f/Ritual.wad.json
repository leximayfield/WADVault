	"description": "This level is designed to be played by one player only. This level is relatively difficult if you aren't a chicken and go with one of the top two difficulty levels. I put more effort in designing this level with the top two difficulty settings; any lower and this should be no prob. This level is loaded with enemies and cool settings. I used a lot of trip wires and many ambushes from both sides. I've given the observant Doomer a lot of hints. You may have thought you cleared out an area but you were wrong, buddy. Ammo shouldn't be a real problem; I mean, you have bigger problems than stinkin' ammo! There is also vending machine where the cost is getting that far! A real handsome level.",
