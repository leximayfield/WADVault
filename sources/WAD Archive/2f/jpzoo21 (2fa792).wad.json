	"description": "Welcome to the Zoo. In the \"Too Young\" skill, I finished the level in 25 minutes (no die, one save). The most difficult thing is to found my face in a texture and the word written on it (Windows Wingdings font coded). Every next level will contains a new word. Putting all the words together makes a sentence about hope ;-) You can exit this level without founding the face (!) Warning: A second face (beta tester) is present, but no word on it. E-mail me the word you founded and how (not with an editor!). I'll E-mail to the first five players the next level (today under construction). E-mail bugs and suggestions. I hope you'll enjoy...",
