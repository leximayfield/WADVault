	"description": "This set of 9 episodes attempts to use mature levels of sophistication and puzzle solving rather than just turning up the volume. Children (you know who you are) may be bored. Levels increase in complexity, difficulty and violence. Definite considerations were given to consistency, theme and fairness. Plan to die a bit, but to be able to finish with a sense of true accomplishment.",
