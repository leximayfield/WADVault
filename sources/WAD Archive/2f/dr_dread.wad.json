	"description": "You start level one at the door to Dr. Dread's secret complex. It is your job to kill as many of the evil Dr.Dread's monster's as you can and return to tell about it. Sounds simple! I have included four level's for your gaming pleasure. Level one is pretty staight forword. It's ment to be the enterance and guard station for the complex. Level two is the \"slim\" refinery and distibution section.This level is my show case where I put most of my best and badest ideas. Level three is Imp holding and breading section. This is a long level that can take easly 30 minutes or more. You have to see the end. It's cool! Level four holds the big things. It's pretty safe if your carfull. I only have four levels at this time but there's many more in the works. Good luck and have fun.",
