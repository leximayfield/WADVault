	"description": "Locals have reported that \"things\" have been sighted at the crumbling villa of the recently deceased Oldrey de Rais. That's why the military chose you, Corporal Flynn Taggart, USMC. Naturally, you and your war comrade Arlene Sanders were sent to investigate, but you have stumbled into something deeper than a mere ghost hunt. They've come back for revenge... and they've got a new weapon to their advantage.",
