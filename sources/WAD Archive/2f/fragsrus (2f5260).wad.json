	"description": "This level has the 'feel' of Doom 2, level 1, has all the weapons including one Bezerk pack and a teleport which can be used for telefragging. It's a fast- paced, small level with enough places to hide from the BFG. Other players can be easily found because this is such a compact level. It's the right time for an X-elent DeathMatch level. Since this is only Warlock's 50th completed WAD, please feel free to e-mail us some feedback about this level. Or if you've recorded a demo and think it has the most frags possible in a demo where -maxdemo 1024 was used, mail it to us and we might put it on our page.",
