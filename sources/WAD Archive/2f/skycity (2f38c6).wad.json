	"description": "Well, this is my second attempt at a pwad. I think this one is a little better than my first attempt (which wasn't that bad - toot toot!! :) SKYCITY is just that - A semi-city stuck 1 mile high in the sky. I created new textures to simulate the effect. It has all new wall textures in it as well as a new sky/floor ...blah blah..... But, PLEASE, run the SKYCITY.BAT file so that you can temporarily put the floor textures into your DOOM.WAD file (yeah, sorry - Can't put new floors into pwads). But, the batch file takes care of it and will restore the original floors when you're done. Back it up if you don't trust me :) I included a .lmp just in case you get a little PO'd trying to find the secrets (They aren't that hard, anyway...)",
