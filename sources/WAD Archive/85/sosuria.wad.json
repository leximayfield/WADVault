	"description": "Sosuria is a proud, peaceful village on the island of Khshayarsha, full of life and hospitality. That is, until one day an evil sorcerer ransacked the land with his army, taking most of the goods and resources for himself and turning the island into an uninhabitable volcanic landscape. Legend has it that a mythical being of wonder dwells in Sosuria's largest and most prominent building, the Temple of the Ancients. It is said that this creature has the ability to turn back time and undo the evil that was dealt to the village. There is only one way to find out if this is true... This is a map I made for SOSU's birthday, which was on the 12th. Limit-removing, 312 monsters on all skill levels, although some do change as well as the locations of many items. This is my first Heretic map.",
