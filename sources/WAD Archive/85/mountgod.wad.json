	"description": "This is my first ever WAD, built over the course of three days while learning the various principles. Overall i dont think it turned out too badly; and you'll be pleased to know that despite the fact that its my first WAD, it does not contain a cyber demon or spider mastermind. Mainly an outdoor map over quite a wide area. Based around a mountain as the title suggests, consisting of three main areas ; the temple, the caverns, and the summit. Please feel free to e-mail me with any comments/suggestions/constructive criticisms you have.",
