	"description": "Resources from the Ancient Aliens megawad. aa-tex.wad contains textures and flats. aa-mons.wad includes the custom monsters and custom decorations used in Ancient Aliens. playpal-aatex.png is the Ancient Aliens palette. You can use it as a base to create your own palettes with additional ranges: it should be clear which ranges are not native to Doom and can be changed to whatever you want. phu_big.bmp is a bitmap font to be used with Bitmap Font Writer. alnarch1.xcf is a GIMP image file for the arch textures. You can use it to make variants of the arches with alternate background textures (a different set of bricks, for instance). See aa-tex-info.txt for some additional instructions if you're unfamiliar with working with custom palettes. You'll need to follow the included steps to import and reindex some IWAD resources into your project.",
