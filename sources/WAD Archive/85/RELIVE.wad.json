	"description": "This is a nine-level WAD file with new graphics, music, and sound FX. The levels are very detailed, and are designed to mimic the \"style\" of the original shareware Doom. I have always thought that the best official Doom levels were the shareware levels. Even though they were too easy, and didn't have the same weapons/monsters variety that Doom 2 does, they LOOKED better than any of the other levels. I think this is because Doom is much better at simulating man-made structures than it is at simulating the \"hell\" type levels.",
