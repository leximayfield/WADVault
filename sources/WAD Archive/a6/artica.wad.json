I spent a good amount of time on lighting(or at least a lot of thought heh), architecture(something Dismemberment wasn't too strong in)and *gasp* texture alignment. The wad is also in two maps becuase WadEd decided that I shouldn't be able add the final area, so it's in a second map. It works out though, because the final area was going to be sealed off from the rest of the map anyway.",
