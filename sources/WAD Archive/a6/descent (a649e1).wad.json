	"description": "10 Map hub for Hexen. A serpent-infested complex reveals portals to various hells. The player must find a way to close the portals for good. Aiming for fairly quick time between sections, for a slightly faster pace than original Hexen. I've managed to learn a bit about scripting and have included some cross-map triggers, building platforms out of lava, earthquakes, ambient sounds, traps and flavor descriptions. Also making use of custom music and the \"fade\" function.",
