	"description": "A speed map which appeared as MAP07 of the 38th Abyssal Speed-Mapping Session. Using the theme of \"Revolving around a powerup\", this small tech base requires the use of the Computer Area Map powerup in order for the player to find their way to the exit. I took the liberty of fixing a door track texture for this version, as it bothered me when I noticed it in ASS38.",
