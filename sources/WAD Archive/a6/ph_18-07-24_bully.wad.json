	"description": "A speed map which appeared as MAP08 of the 37th Abyssal Speed-Mapping Session. This open arena has the player platforming over deadly lava, avoiding a cyberdemon and other enemies in order to get to the end. A Plasma Rifle is available and ammo is trickle-fed to the player so they can fight on the way round, but speed can be helpful in allowing the player to gain room early on. The theme undertaken was \"20 monsters\".",
