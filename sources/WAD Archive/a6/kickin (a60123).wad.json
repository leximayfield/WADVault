	"description": "This is my second .wad file and I thought it turned out pretty good. It's a small deathmatch .wad for two or three people. All the weapons are included but you're out in the open for any big weapons. We played the level quite a few times and there are no bugs. My only problem is the ceiling and floor textures on the teleporters.",
