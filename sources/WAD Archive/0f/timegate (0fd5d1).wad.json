	"description": "Purely deathmatch! Has nearly every weapon, except for the regular shotgun and pistols which bite anyway. Explore this level, learn where to step, and where NOT to step... This is my second wad I have made that doesn't really SUCK. There is one place in the level where you can obtain an invulnerability, a BFG, map, some energy cells, an invisibility, and a Megasphere, but the question is can you get there without DYING?!?!?!?!?! HAHAHAHAHHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH!!!!!!!!! There is an exit, for people such as Daniel who lie about FRAG COUNTS!!!!",
