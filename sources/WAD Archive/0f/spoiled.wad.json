You start in an underground, cave-like area, go through some darker base rooms and end up on the shores of a huge nukage lake. Nukage is a reoccurring theme throughout the whole level. I've tested mostly on Ultra Violence. It is beatable on that difficulty without using any secrets (they will help a lot though).",
