	"description": "This is a sound patch for DOOM which will replace about 95% of the sounds in the game with amusing phrases and sounds from a couple Disney films. You will probably use this wad a lot, especially since it is one of the best Disney sound wads available to date. This sound collection is big. Yup, that's right, a whole 1.4 Megs. Got a problem? Well, too bad. What you are getting is state of the art, 8 bit 11khz digitized speech and sound from one of the second best animation companies in the world. (Not directly, of course.) Please e-mail us with your comments and suggestions. First one to do so wins a genuine Mickey Mouse (TM) Watch, courtesy of the Disney Store. (Or a guy on the corner of Lexington and Fifth) (Restrictions apply. See below for details.)",
