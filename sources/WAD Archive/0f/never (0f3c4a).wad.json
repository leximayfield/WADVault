	"description": "A really cool castle wad. NEVER is a REAL challenge in UV. There are some tough secrets to find, and there are tons of baddies. Death matchers should have a blast as well as singles. So what's the description? Get the wad and check it out! Compared to other 'non-linear' levels, this one is really non-linear. It's also pretty well inter-connected for DM after all the secrets are found. It features the Death Room, a cool outside area where you can jump all over the place, a multi-leveled maze type thing, and the dreaded caco-lair! No stupid switch puzzels or death traps. A straight forward ass kick'n wad.",
