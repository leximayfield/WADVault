	"description": "Jiffy Bag is a collection of 32 random maps made by me over the last 5 years or so. The maps all vary quite dramatically in theme, and are similar only in terms of size and design - given the short time I had to make these in, my general approach to mapping is pretty obvious in how each map plays and is structured, but this should hopefully contribute to a well-rounded, consistent end product.",
