	"description": "I made most of this level about three years ago but never released it until now. seems really hard and I can't guarantee it's fun to play, but I found it on my hard drive and it seems basically done so I wanted to inject a few microcells of life back into the dying classic Doom community. In better news Doom 2016 and Eternal Doom seem super great and hopefully that will keep the franchise alive. I just played through this level to make sure everything works and it seems like it also it's really hard at least to me. That's all I have to say ATM",
