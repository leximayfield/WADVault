	"description": "The entire level is a big room in the shape of a rectangle. There are ten rooms that are on the edge of the rectangle. Each room has a switch that opens a passageway to the next room - but it also open a door three rooms along that contains monsters. Each switch opens a door with increasingly more difficult monsters. The exit door is obviously in the final room - that when the fun starts.",
