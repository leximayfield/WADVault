	"description": "This is a complete level for DooM II. I made it with single player in mind, haven't tested in DeathMatch or Cooperative, but it should work ( there are deathmatch weapons and starts ). Watch out with the pools, once inside there is no way out ( at least alive :). This is my first WAD, so it's not very pretty, but it has some creative secrets and traps. Plenty of pain. Enjoy! If you have comments please e-mail me.",
