	"description": "Great deathmatch wads that play great in both deathmatch modes.(Except Map01) Map01 is just a small tight but smoothe duel-type level. I made it as small and as light as possible for all of those whose systems have problems with those huge deathmatch levels. Good for 2,3 or even 4 platers. Map02 is for 2,3 or 4 players. Map03 is best with 2 players. Map04 is best with 4 players. All maps are made with Deathmatch 1 in mind but all of them except Map01 have enough ammo and power-ups for Altdeath.",
