	"description": "Like AG Assault, one guy on platform, other guy hides behind barriers, lotsa weapons and stuff. Nice cool music to set the tone. Sometimes both guys end up on the same level. This is really fun - chasing the other guy around the 'arena', like a wild goose hunt. TIP: click on that pillar on the top level... neato! You really have to see what's in that neato pillar! -=- Play AGMax.wad NOW! -=-",
