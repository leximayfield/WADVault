	"description": "Do you like a soda-themed level? Here you have it; Pepsi Apocalypse. It has a lot of red, gray, and blue to match the colors of a Pepsi logo. Music is \"Wicked Child\" from Castlevania. Credit goes to Chris Balch for the Slaughterfest 2012 thread that included the textures that I used, which include sf2012-tex, cc4-tex, GOTHICTX, q1tex, and NB_RECOL, as well as for the title screen and the intermission. Additional credit goes to the person who made level 39 from Chillax because this level is inspired by it.",
