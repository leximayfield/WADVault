	"description": "A small present for Christmas of year 2012 and for the 21th bithday of Lainos, author of Sacrament, Doxylamine Moon: Overdose, 5till L1 Complex, Object 32-33-34 and several other cool maps. Previously, I wanted to make a city level which is similar to Doxylamine Moon: Overdose, as a tribute, but I had lack of ideas and inspiration, so I decided to make it as a present. Well, it seems it was successfull. =) Very important note: I integrated the map to the original Doxylamine OD file, which means that I changed the levels and their names only + I added one texture (LAINOS), which is a photo from Lainos. =)",
