	"description": "One hole episode of FAST deathmatch levels. The exit for level 9 (the hidden level) is in level 3, but it is NOT hidden, but the normal exit is hidden. This .wad has been tested with 2,3 and 4 players and no problems were found. With 4 players some of the levels felt a little crowded, but still were fun anyway. All these levels are quite small and can easily be played with 2 players, but we usually play these levels with 4 players and love them all.",
