	"description": "35 Levels for Zdoom, Plus 5 secret levels. Each level has all new challenges awaiting you. Plenty of use of the features in Zdoom like stealth enemies. There are also some new enemies capable of peforming the most unexpected tricks. There is no scripting this wad because I havent figured it out. The new enemies are a Spectre in one of the secret levels and a deadly floating Romero head. The five Secret levels like the two secret levels in the original Bella are all stunning. There is also a practice level included. Many styles of maps are included, from base to hellish to spaceship.",
