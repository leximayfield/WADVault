	"description": "This WAD started as an experiment in gun-activated switches that manipulate textures. I borrowed a cool texture technique from Brian Martin's DDAY3_3.WAD. You'll know what I mean when you see it. A small map suitable for massive amounts of death. There are shotguns, SS's, rockets and plasma weapons, and a BFG. An Exit, as well. Intended for deathmatch. Please E-mail your reviews of this WAD. I'd like to know how I did!",
