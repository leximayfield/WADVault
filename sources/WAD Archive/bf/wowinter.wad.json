	"description": "LOAD WITH CC4 TEXTURES AND PLAY WITH GZDOOM. ALLOW JUMPING AND CROUCHING. \"World of Winter\" is a single-player map originally disguised as a \"wow.wad\" joke. The goal was to trick the player into assuming that this wad/map was a regularly playing map until they fall into a HOM pit with a cyberdemon. Special thanks to: \"Ed the Bat\", \"THE ULTRA ATOMIC!\", \"Enjay\", \"mouldy\", \"Memfis\", \"Obsidian\" and a few others for playing through this wad.",
