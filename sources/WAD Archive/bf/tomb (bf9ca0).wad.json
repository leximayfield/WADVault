	"description": "Tomb Deathmatch....wow, I finally finished it! Can you guess where it's set in? A tomb and a church, and the connecting hallways and staircases. It has lots of special effects (torches lighting, phased lighting, some polyobjects), and is a great DM. The church is old and ruined, with broken stained-glass, out-of-place pews, and old chandeliers...the tomb is even older; rotting corpses, rotating walls, spiderwebs, and lots of dark phased lighting. Have fun with it! Please write me with any comments or bugs.",
