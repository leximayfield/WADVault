	"description": "I finished this level just as Quake shareware was released. Consequently this level has been sadly underplayed. So PLAY IT!, or I will hunt you down and frag you. For the record, Quake is great. If you can't get through on ultra-violent swollow your pride and try it on easier settings, thats what they're there for. By the way, this is both a deathmatchable an solo-able level.",
