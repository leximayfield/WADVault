	"description": "Here it is! The lastest edition of the Starman : series. With this version of the Starman series : I hoped to take care of some of the cheapness : that has been taking place in all the other starman : wads. Not so much in 3+ player modes, but mostly : in 1-on-1 matches. This problem was solved with : the windows to catch some of the hiding out in the : large rooms. The wad is really cool in 4 : player mode free for all or 2-on-2. 1-on-1 matches : are finally fair for a change! This wad can be used : for acurate skill testing as well. Enjoy! Next : in the series is on its way ;).",
