	"description": "The general idea is to loosely recreate each episode of Doom but summed up with 2 maps per episode. Each map tries to emulate the mapping styles of the original doom. Also features a secret level, which is more of its own thing, as well as a deathmatch map (e2m1). For the best experience I recommend playing with just the keyboard.",
