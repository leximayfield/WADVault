	"description": "This is an arena-type deathmatch pwad that I made for tournaments held by H2H in San Diego (619-426-0073). Please, don't confuse Arenas with H2H Czech Series. Arenas are smaller, designed only for deathmatch. Although you can play Arenas solo or in co-op (more monsters), they are made for deathmatch with ALTDEATH in mind.",
