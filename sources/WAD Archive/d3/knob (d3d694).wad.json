	"description": "This level is the first of more of it's type. It is pure carnage! I encourage the use of cheat-codes, in fact, I don't know if the level is possible without them. I love shooting things, and to me, that's the greatest thing about Doom ][. I took special care to make many monsters fight amongst themselves, as this adds to the \"entertainment\". Watch your back (as well as the next in the KNOB series.)!",
