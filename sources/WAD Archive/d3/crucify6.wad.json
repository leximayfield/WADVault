	"description": "It's very straight-forward and to the point in this level. I believe there is a good distribution of weapons. I've also included the BFG for all you \"silent BFG\" gurus out there. There is a strong possibility of a few telefrags in this level! You can also get blown out a few windows too if you don't watch out! I believe this level is great for 2 players, and 4 players should be a fragfest! The exit can be obtained by one person but you better haul ass, especially when you're playing a match because you'll be fragmeat real fast! The exit should be of mutual agreement anyway. By the way, you figure out how to get to the exit. (heh)",
