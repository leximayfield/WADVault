	"description": "A largish level, with monsters from lots of unexpected places, and a few cool ideas to show off, including some nice light- sourcing (sort of). This is a level to make the cautious wary, and the brash, dead. To set the scene, read the story at the end of this text. Only weapons and monsters from Episode 1 are included. Not suitable for a Deathmatch, although the start locations are in there.",
