	"description": "This is the first level of what I hope will be a whole episode. The scenario is basically a prison where the inmates have done in every guard in the whole place. They have taken over. They now control the prison. You have been sent in to bring order back to the prison (well, just kill the bastards no one will mind). You start on the helipad and it's a fight from the beginning. From here you must arm yourself to the teeth and make your way to the elevator and then it's down to the horrors below. Many have talked about the strange genetic experiments that have been performed on some of the inmates. But don't worry they'll be below. Up on the surface you'll just meet the regular guys.",
