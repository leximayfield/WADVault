	"description": "This is a very small level. The rooms are small because I didn't have a sense of scale. It is a supposed rebel base that has been taken over by Imperials. You mission if you choose to take it is to eradicate the enemey and find the computer map (HINT!!! its by the last key). I used alot of different effects as many I could. I even included one smashing effect!!!",
