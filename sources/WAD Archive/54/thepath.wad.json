	"description": "This is a huge wad that is set way under ground. It is totally futureistic and includes many clever effects. Even though this wad is massive, (over 6000 linedefs) it is not annoying in the sense that it is just one huge maze that take 5 hours to complete. The whole wad flows in one direction you never feel that you are not getting anywhere. So, the massive amount of linedefs have gone into brilliant, intricute and well thought out architecture .",
