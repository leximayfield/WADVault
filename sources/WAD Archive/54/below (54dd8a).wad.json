	"description": "My first levels ever. More will be added in future releases. No jumping and crouching, with freelook. In the first map \"Entrance\", you find the entrance to a hidden cave and while venturing below, uncover remnants of old ruins and a hidden temple with the entrance to the second level \"Realm of Sakkath\". There, you follow the path of water to monster-infested lava caves. In a huge hall, the giant door to the third level, \"Temple of Hate\", awaits. All maps are small/medium-sized. map01: \"Entrance\" map02: \"Realm of Sakkath\" map03: \"Temple of Hate\" If you find texture-errors, bugs, etc. please do not hesitate to contact me, so i can update the wad and others may benefit from.",
