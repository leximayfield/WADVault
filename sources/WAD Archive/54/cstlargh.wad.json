	"description": "This is a deathmatch area. There's a castle with 4 corner towers. There's a moat around the castle. Inside on the bottom floor there is a maze at the center of which is the map's only megasphere. But, you have to press the button in one of the 4 corner towers to lower it. So... good luck with that.",
