	"description": "This is the first map of my current project, Death Summoning. Since I seriously doubt I'll ever actually finish this project, I've decided to release the project map by map, as each map is finished. Map01 is a small tech map. If you notice any problems with this map, feel free to email me at: zimspork@comcast.net . NOTE: This map may be changed by the time the project is completely finished. ZDoom version to come soon...",
