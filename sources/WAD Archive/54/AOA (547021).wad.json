	"description": "Small and furious! Looks kinda like a tiny mansion complete with large den, fireplace, library, and various other niceties. Just has that homey, cozy feel to it. Don't mind the blood on the wall or the guns in plain sight of the kids. The courtyard may or may not be accessible and getting outside will get you more then a scratch!",
