	"description": "A 40-60 minutes level for almost vanilla setting of Heretic. Well, map itself is vanilla but it uses DECORATE to make firemace always spawn, so it's actually ZDoom thing. This level is a proof to myself that I don't suck, as my only portfolio, so to say, are not-so-good maps that I have done as a teen. Anyway, all cool people scroll down below this txt to read protips. If you don't read them, your opinion is not valid.",
