	"description": "Well, you know the story. UAC keeps sending you different places on Titan to investigate various strange occurences. You keep telling them that there are aliens on Titan. You reported this after nearly getting your head taken off in the Mines. You told them again when they lost the Anomaly site. Your investigation of the loss of communication at the Farside base also mentioned this. They're starting to believe you, I think, except for the Psychology department anyway - they're still holding out for their space psychosis theory. Its a compromise, you're being sent again, but as usual, you only get a pistol... just in case there aren't any aliens after all.",
