	"description": "<Insert dramatic lead-in story here> This DOOM II WAD was designed with the idea that Deathmatch play should be fast, fun, and competetive. I got ideas from several places. For single play, try out the included patch file. It modifies the enemies and makes them very similar to playing against a human opponenent. For deathmatch I feel I have balanced the number of bonuses, with the size of the level. I also tried to balance the layout of teleporters, barriers, weapons, and lifts to make play fun and difficult. Additional Credits to : Anyone who wants it",
