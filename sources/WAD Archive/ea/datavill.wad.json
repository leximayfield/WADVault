	"description": "My first map for HacX, and the first of my 'Alternative HacX' series. On the HacX front, I am dedicated to making HacX maps as constructed from the original plan - given to me by Nostromo along with HacX v1.0 and 1.1. As this map is cyberspace, I had some trouble finding matching textures and flats - it may look ugly to you in parts, but that is not entirely my fault. Forgive me if the outer area lacks detail, but I really couldn't be bothered to make all those other buildings blink as well. :-) (After all, the Internet was not designed with aesthetics in mind.) This WAD has new music, written HacX-style by me, it is included in the WAD as a MIDI file for all you budding composers out there to goggle at and admire. :-)",
