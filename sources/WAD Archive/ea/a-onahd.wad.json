	"description": "This wad is the prequel to GAMMA. I implied that the story would make sense once you played the prequel, so here's the story: Colonel Burlap, Linguica's commanding officer and long time friend has asked him to reclaim the denture factory that has been overrun by demons. Something's fishy here. Luckily he installed a psychic data link into his forehead that allows him to communicate telepathically through computer terminals. Oh and his girlfriend Alyssa went missing.",
