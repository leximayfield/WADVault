	"description": "A Warm Place is for E1M1 as the filename suggests. It contiains some designs and techniques I haven't seen in any other wadfile, along with borrowing some styles from my favorites. It is a somewhat difficult level, no great puzzles or brainteasers, just a fun level. On skill 1, while knowing where everything is, going everywhere and getting 100% on everything, it took me 5:07 to beat.",
