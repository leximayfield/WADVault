	"description": "By far the biggest of the (now) five eulogys. Also the toughest. Recently many people have been telling me that Eulogy 3 was the best out of the first four. I asked myself: \"Why is that?\" After playing Eulo1-4 for a while, I relaized that, despite Eulogy 3's small size, it has incredible flow, and is packed with monsters, and therefore, it's great fun. I took that up a few notches with eulo5. This map is pretty damn hard on skill 4 and pretty damn easy on skill 1.",
