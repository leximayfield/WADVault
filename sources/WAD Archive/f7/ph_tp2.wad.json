	"description": "A compilation of Tiny Pack 1 (Tiny Chances of Survival), which has been bug-fixed and updated to use the ZMAPINFO format, and the new first (and only) level in Tiny Pack 2 (Minimal Resistance). Has two difficulty modes (\"Easy\" and \"Tough\") and plays in single player only. All levels are very small and have speed-running par times recorded. Story is at the end of the text file, before the copyrights section. This project has been abandoned, but released in a playable state for your enjoyment.",
