	"description": "The Nadir is a short (~2 hours) Hexen adventure that aims to extend the experience once the vanilla game and expansion end. I found myself wanting to play more Hexen after completing these, so the result wasThe Nadir. This is a project I created as a personal goal and for my own enjoyment, but decided later in the creation process that I would share it with others who enjoy this game and user-created material.",
