	"description": "This is a set of four \"fast frag\" deathmatch levels for Doom 2. Lev.1 - Blackfrag This is a remake of my first blackfrag level. It is like a figure-eight level with a hallway circling the whole thing. Windows allow easy finding of enemies and weapons 5-7 take a little time to get. Contains a few new textures to add to its black look. Playtested many times and is considered the best of the bunch.",
