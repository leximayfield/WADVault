	"description": "You humiliated the Barons of Hell in DOOM. You destroyed them in DOOM II. Now they want revenge. There inviting you to their world. Don't think that this level only has Hell Knights and Barons of Hell, it has a variety of monsters. You take their invitation and rush to your room. They stole your weapons! Good thing you had your pistol in your holster. You hear a portal open behind you. Even without your trusty BFG-9000, you're going to have to make it out of here, alive.",
