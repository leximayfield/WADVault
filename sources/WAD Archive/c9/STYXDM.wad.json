	"description": "This a compilation of Richard Jaspars 'Styx' excellent Styx Deathmatch Series. I've changed nothing in the levels themselves (except rename them sequentialy). I added a mapinfo.lmp to the combined wad to keep the music and skies as Richard originally released them. I also renamed the music lmps for the same purpose. The reason for compiling these levels was to make it easier to use them in client-server based multiplayer games such as Skulltag and ZDaemon.",
