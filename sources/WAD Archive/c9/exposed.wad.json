	"description": "Exposed is by far the most architecuraly detailed level that I`ve built to date. I tried very hard to make the level look both varied and interesting throughout, and despite the textures looking similar I think I achieved this. Believe it not this level took less than 2 hours to build but testing seemed to take forever. I`m not sure if Exposed surpasses my previous efforts, you`ll just have to make your own mind up on that one. I just hope you can enjoy Exposed for what it is, a cracking level with shit hot looks to match.",
