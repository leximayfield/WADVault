	"description": "This is the final version of Newmaps. Newmaps is a Chex Quest mod (*cough*) based on The Ultimate Chex Quest. In May 2005 I came across The Ultimate Chex Quest. Then I saw some of the fanmade maps and thought: \"Hey! Why don't I try my hand at making Chex Quest levels?\" And so Newmaps was started. In June of 2005 I released the first beta which only had the first two maps complete. Back then, I only planned to make five or so levels, but then I started making more and more and it became this big thing. I don't even want to think of how many hours I put into it. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it for you. (Man, how many times has this been said before?) (NOTE: If you just play the first few levels and decide it's too boring and stop playing, don't. Remember, I had just learned to map when I made those. The later ones are much cooler!)",
