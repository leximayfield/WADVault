	"description": "My first four maps I put together over two weeks or so. The main intent was to have some fun, though not very challenging, gameplay. School's started back up, and I WAS going to do a major revamp of this, but don't have the time right now and would rather move on to new maps altogether. So, here they are in their final form. VERY slight tweaks.",
