	"description": "If you are tired of complete the 32 levels of Doom II and you finished R.J.G. Stark Base. then you have been trained for this. The new argument?: The big explosion of the Magna Reactor in R.J.G. Stark Base opens a hole in the timeline. And you fall on it..... Your eyes lights up, wandered because you are live, the first thing you do is to talk via radio to the Doom Team, The commander recognize you, WOW..., You are in 1999, 3 years... You walk and look around: Former R.J.G. Stark Base is now a small city in middle of radioactive desert, everything seems different, Barons of Hells are extinct, CyberDemons and Spider Mastermind are discontinued forever. Everything is new technology: The powerful Golden Walker, The new plasma fire gun, with a little wide range, the BFG10000, now toasts the enemy, and an UAC supersecret weapon system. Oh no, your signal has been intercepted, you are discovered, you must escape!!!, if you try to go to radioactive desert you surely will die. The only way is to touch the four Sacred Gems in the city in order to activate the Mystical Transportator somewhere. It's no easy, but you're ... you! So, once again, can get stuck off?",
