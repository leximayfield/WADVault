	"description": "Another UAC experiment gone arri. This time they sent a scout in first to check out the area (you). What you saw was an ancient civilization who worshiped you like a god! At least they did, now you are tied up in a corner and your captives, who just yesterday were hailing you as their leader are now preparing to sacrifice you! They took your chaingun away from you and placed it on an alter, but htey didn't know about your shotgun. When most of them are looking away you whip that baby out and hope that they haven't gone through to your side.",
