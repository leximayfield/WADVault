	"description": "The Apocalyspe has finally come to pass... all of Earth lies in ruin after a world-wide nuclear war. You are a lone infantry soldier who has managed to survive. You were lucky (depends on how you look at it) to be in an underground bunker when a nuke hit near your location. After the radiation levels dropped off, you left to search for more supplies. After many days of wandering.... you have come to realize the awful truth... the Earth as you knew it is no more. You can find no signs of civilization or life... except of course if you count the undead. The spawn of hell now roam the Earth... You never really believed so strongly in the super-natural untill now (and you think that pissed them off). You are about to give up and accept death when you come across a city! Maybe there are people alive there! Maybe there are fresh supplies! Or worse yet... maybe the undead, or even worse... perhaps enemy soldiers could be lurking in that city. Only one way to find out.....",
