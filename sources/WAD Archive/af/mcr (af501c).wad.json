	"description": "This level has a lot of brown and green in it, which is why I gave it the title. Do you remember levels 4 and 12 from Back to Nirvana X Episode 1? This level combines the elements from the levels into a single one. It involves the cybers killing off the cacodemons and viles resurrecting them after activating the crushers. Musis is \"Force of Darkness\" by Knightrider of Doom.",
