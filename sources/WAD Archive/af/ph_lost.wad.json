	"description": "Originally intended as MAP29 of Triacontathlon, I gave this a test as I couldn't remember what it was like and was shocked at the difficulty, so decided it's best served as an individual release. It's a \"grind map\", which I made in 11 hours of mapping in a 12-hour period. Play style is an adventure through a range of death traps before fighting enemies in a slightly less linear temple.",
