By the way if you're one of those who plays the first 2 maps and says, \"Eh..\", start on 12 so you can see the really good ones. Many of these maps will look like other maps... Well, my excuse is that any good WAD builder needs inspiration. So I take the ideas out of popular WADs and tweak them a little, making them much better, and of course I make all my stuff from scratch remember.. Everything in this package was made by ME, Fuzz. Hope you like it, and I'll tell ya right now my favorite map is 20. Have fun and dont forget to try my patches... See ya on DWANGO...",
