	"description": "This is an unoffical sequel to Richard Wilkins's map \"GET OFF MY LAND\". While I found the title hilarious, I was sorely disappointed by the wad itself, which was something typical of 1994 or so and had nothing to do with crotchety old farmers waving their fists and reloading their shotguns. Now I've made a wad with the same title, but closer to what I had imagined a wad with the name \"GET OFF MY LAND\" would be.",
