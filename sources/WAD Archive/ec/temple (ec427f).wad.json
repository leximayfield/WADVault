	"description": "This wad is an original wad created using DOOMCAD 6.1 It took me about two months to complete in my spare time. When creating it I started with a single room and just kept adding stuff until I was satisfied (check out the throne room!). I designed it to be played as both a single player and multi/death-match player wad (difficulty levels 1-2 for death-match). There are several hidden doors, secret rooms, suprises, and many monsters on higher difficulty settings. I put a lot of attention to detail and haven't found any bugs. The single player mode was tested extensively but I didn't have anyone to test multi or deathmatch modes with. There are a couple of spots where, in death-match you can ambush your buddy (a crushing ceiling in the red room, and a hole in the spine hall where you can pop up out of the floor when he steps across a line). This is my first attempt at creating a WAD so please be kind. Enjoy!!! (please tell my what you think!!!) glover@starwell.com",
