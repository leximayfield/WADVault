	"description": "This is a heavily retooled version of the map I submitted to NOVA II all those months ago. It's far more detailed, more streamlined, has more involved combat, new music, and an entirely new section based off of that one scene from House where the dude goes into the mirror and explores the dark spooky void. The map itself is a rather melancholy trek through a dark, mountainous environment and the many nearby caverns, moving towards a humble water treatment plant. What dark secrets does it all hold oohsuspensesuspense. I also did a weird trick where I placed lamps and torches behind wall lights so it would look like they're glowing in advanced sourceports. The reason this version wasn't added to NOVA II is because Gobu says he prefers the original. Personally I like this version, so I'm more than happy to keep my preffered rendition all to myself :p",
