	"description": "A speedmap I made for a speedmapping project, which I subsequently decided to instead release stand-alone. Original version of the map was made in a little under 4 hours, and the final version took an extra 2-3 hours of additional polishing, gameplay tweaking, automap cleanup, and all that other lovely stuff. The speedmapping stipulations I followed for this map were: use only 6 textures & 6 flats (not including skies); and 46 monsters. I decided to round up the monster count to a clean ~~~50 Monsters~~~ when I was polishing the gameplay.",
