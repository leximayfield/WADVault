I tried a lot of known excellent deathmatch WADs(the MARKRM series, LEDGES...) and I like this one, too :-) BTW, if you don't know, \"kewl\" is a way of writing \"cool\" :-) I got WadEd 1.42 with DooM II support today. So I changed a few textures&stuff, put in the SSGUN, so now my nice DooM DeathMatch WAD is playable in a much better DooM II version! Have phun... Using -altdeath is absolutely necessary!",
