	"description": "Oh, dear. Where do I start? Years ago, after playing Mock 2 for the first time, I decided to try my hand at some terribly-stupid maps. A few months later, SHiTWADS was born. Not long after, it was followed by a spiritual sequel, \"Lost SOulsphere!\". Though it didn't play as well, it was rather funny and the later \"Gold Edition\" wound up becoming a cult classic in the Doom world. Not to be outdone by myself, I decided to create a third project, even worse than the rest. \"W0R5T #U8\" (worsthub.wad) is quite possibly one of the most terrible, nonsensical, and annoying wads in the history of mankind. Good for a laugh or two, but that's about it. I thought I had done it. I lay claim to the worst wad in existence. Apparently I didn't know how to stop. This is SHiTWADS IV: T3H SUCK! It's worse than Worst Hub. Seriously.",
