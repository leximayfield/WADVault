	"description": "Yet another Phobos base-themed episode, although I tried that levels actually looked like what they're named after, instead of looking like just generic bases like they did in the original game (don't take me wrong by the way, I LOVE the original game maps :). Also, while the maps are meant to be more detailed than the original levels, they are by no means as detailed as in some other WADs like KDIZD, for example.",
