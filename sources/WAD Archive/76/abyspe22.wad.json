	"description": "17 maps made during the twenty-second Abyssal Speedmapping Session. Unlike normal sessions this one focused on collaborations, with mappers given two hours to work on a map before passing it off to the next guy. While the goal was to finish in 24 hours, the mapping process ran long, and some maps were polished well past the 24 hour time limit.",
