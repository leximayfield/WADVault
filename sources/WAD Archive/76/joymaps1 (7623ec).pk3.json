	"description": "This was a livestreamed communal mapping session that took place on July 23rd, 2016, with participants mapping under the strict guidance of Jimmy and a few session tutors via Discord and TwitchTV. The mappers were talking through the basics of mapping, such as creating connected areas, interesting layouts, and using thing placement sensibly. In hopefully the first of many similar live tutorial sessions! The participants mapped in a variety of formats, mostly Boom and ZDoom (UDMF).
