	"description": "Heart is the third level in the Grind series, following Grind2 and Dream. This level took a lot of time to complete, especially some of the detailing. It took forever to get the ammo/health balance right but I've beaten it a few times now and my testers inform me it's not impossible. The level was up to 15,000 SideDefs before I packed them (13,420 SideDefs packed), making this my largest level even though it's a fairly small map.",
