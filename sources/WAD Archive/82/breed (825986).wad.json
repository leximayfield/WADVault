	"description": "My first attempt at creating a WAD for Doom. Actually, finished this about 2 months ago and never got around to putting it on line. You enter this mission to try to destroy a group of madmen who are breeding imps and other \"nasties\". This level is not difficult, but does have a few surprises. A few secret rooms are scattered about, with a few \"goodies\" in them. I learned much while creating this level, and this will be seen when I finish my second level... Any comments are welcomed and appreciated.",
