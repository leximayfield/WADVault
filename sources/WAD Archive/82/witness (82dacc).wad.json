	"description": "After some time far from the doomworld I return with this episode, it is like favillesco alpha regarding to visuals mixed with mano laikas gameplay with its doom2 bestiary and rocket launcher induced combat, I'm kind of addicted to those alpha textures so I made 9 more maps with them and also allowed myself to make some theme variation like the tunnels of map03 or the tech neighbourhood of map07. Next time I'll make something completely different, I hope it won't take much time.",
