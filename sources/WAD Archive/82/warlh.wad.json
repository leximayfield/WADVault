	"description": "Your world is collapsing around you and your only hope is a portal leading to further danger. Once home to a powerful warlock, his demonic minions are now free to use his magical abode to open portals to distant lands as they see fit. They should be stopped. The Warlock's Hearth is a very large map for limit-removing ports with an emphasis on atmosphere, exploration and enjoyable fights that still challenge the player without putting the pressure on all the time. The map features an .ogg soundtrack courtesy of Der Wolfmensch (Marco from Decoded Feedback's sideproject).",
