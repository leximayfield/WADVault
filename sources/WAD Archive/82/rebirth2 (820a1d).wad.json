	"description": "This is basically doom2 level1, but i have added a few things. I changed the look and made that famous courtyard that is unaccessible in doom2 level 1 accessible. I made this wad because alot of ppl like to play this wad usin 4 player DM play.. THis will make it alot better. *New To Rebirth2.wad- Well we played alot of the first one, and i got some feedbak and ideas. So i put em in. Now this is the ultimate Doom2 Level1 Replacement. Awesome 4 player experience. This is a must for doom2 tournaments. I added a few enhancements over rebirth1, like new safe deathmatch starts. No more lame frags. Umm, i added alot of cool sniper spots and a whirlpool(sorta). Other cool things, must play to see.",
