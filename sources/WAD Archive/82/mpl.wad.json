	"description": "3 very much Plutonia-inspired maps. Some trivia: The last map (06) was first finished 2010 for Plutonia Revisited, but was omitted from the project so I released it seperately. The other two are new maps. Note that these maps are placed as map04-06, and not 01-03. I should also recommend the use of savegames when you play map06 as that map has a lot of trial-and-error gameplay.",
