	"description": ") SO Ever play games like Photon, or Laser Quest? Games Where you and 20 of your friends enter a dark warehouse-like place armed with infra-red guns and chest packs and run around trying to shoot each other? I've tried to capture the same spirit in Skulker. Recommended for 4 player net play, but will \"play\" ok with 2 people over serial link, although there will be times where, with two players, you'll be hunting each other down for two or three minutes at a time without firing a shot. The term \"So close yet so far away\" fits perfectly.",
