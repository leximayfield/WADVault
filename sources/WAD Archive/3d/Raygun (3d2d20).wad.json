	"description": "This is my first WAD. Designed for single player, multiple player or Deathmatch modes, easy, medium or hard. One of the qualities of DOOM is that it allows vertical motion. I tried to take advantage of that when designing this level. This is a large WAD, lots of bad guys, traps and puzzles. This is a long course. My best times so far are 7:14 min. with no monsters and about 28 min. at UV.",
