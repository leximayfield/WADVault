	"description": "This is Dione Attack's do-over remake with new levels full of hellspawn. If you played the original Dione Attack, play this to see the amazing difference between the two. PS: To beat level 7, just kill the mancubi and arachnotrons, the cyberdemon is just there to amp up the difficulty in killing them.",
