	"description": "This is a 16 skin pack of various charmanders from the upcoming \"Attack of the Anatomically Correct Charmanders!\" jokewad. As the final product will have models instead of sprites, I've decided to release these pre-release sprites now as a few people have asked me for them. There's a whole host of random requests, including one for Untamed which I did for help above and beyond the call of duty. :)",
