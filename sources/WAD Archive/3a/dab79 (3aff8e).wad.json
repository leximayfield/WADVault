	"description": "Very large base. Mostly non-linear gameplay. Lots of exploration but plenty of action and surprises and mystery. The layout is not too confusing but you'll need to check your map from time to time. This is a huge and epic map which takes about 2 hours to complete. I'm going for a Doom + Doom II only style map so NO JUMPING / NO CROUCHING.",
