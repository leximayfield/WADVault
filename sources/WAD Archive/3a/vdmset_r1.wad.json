	"description": "Deathmatch map set inspired by Cyb's Void and American McGee's Alice. More maps are in development; map11 here is actually map12 in the final pack. At least 3 maps are missing from this release. This map pack is designed for new-school configuration (freelook and jump especially, and also no infinite actor height); attempts to do play with other settings will be painful.",
