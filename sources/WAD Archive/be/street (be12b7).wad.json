	"description": "A street crossing and four buildings at it. Funny deathmatch level. The red warehouse contains all the weapons, but the rocket launcher and the BFG. The brown house is something like a hospital. There also is a kind of sewers. Every building has a access to the sewers (The BFG is somewhere down there). Be aware that the switches in a garage-like building are used to release cybers. Play it, enjoy it.",
