	"description": "I made two versions of this(both are in the zip): the normal version is the one where you can fall into the lava on the outer medkit/armor platforms, the alternate version has midbars3 and impassable lines around the outside of the platforms. Anyways to the main description: A tower with all the weapons except Plasma and BFG. Even a berserk pack. (Editor's Note: Wow this description is pretty fucking useless considering most of the people playing this will only ever see one of the maps. Or are you just a cruel bastard, taunting the players with what you can't have? Get out, Infurnus. Get out.)",
