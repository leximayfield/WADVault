	"description": "A fairly small and easy E1-style map. I made this map to have exactly 75 monsters, an idea that came about as a result of playing the various 1024 megawads and realizing that despite the small size a lot of them seemed very long and grueling to play through. I wondered what it would be like to make a map with a theme that forced the mapper to make a 'bite-sized' Doom experience, and came up with the idea of making a map with 50 monsters, no more, no less. Once I started making this map I decided 75 might work better.",
