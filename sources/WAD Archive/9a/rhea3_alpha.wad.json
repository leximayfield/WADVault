	"description": "Ah Rhea 3. The third map in my Rhea series of Doom2 maps. I started this map around the time Half-Life was released, as being inspired by HLs arcitecture. I orginally wanted to create my own megawad called \"The Rhea Conspricy\", but as I one man project started during my highschool years, that never happened. So when I discovered the Doom community was \"thriving\" I decided to create and small hub based episode instead. But \"Real Life\" and sheer laziness killed that swiftly. It was suppose to be my own personal end-all-be-all of Doom projects that I had planned. This map was planned to be the central hub for the Rhea3 complex. Six maps (including this one) were to make up the massive station of the Rhea3 complex. Well, as one can see that isn't happening any time soon. Anyway, I've final decided to quit beating the proverbile dead horse and call it quits for Rhea3 and let it die peacefully.",
