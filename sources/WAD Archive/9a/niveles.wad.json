	"description": "A compilation of 27 levels (the three series from the original Doom), that I made between 1994 and 2000. But they weren't conceived as a complete and coherent episode. There isn't storyline or something similar, and most of these maps were constructed without any previous planning. In any case, they're grouped in three series, in the same way that the original episodes from Doom. The usual; my first episode has a futurist ambientation, the second introduces some bloody details, and the third takes us directly to the hell... At this time, I must recognize that these levels aren't going to impress anybody; they're very old, and look like this... But they haven't major bugs, and I think that the maps are quite playable. Some of them are aesthetic and have a exciting gameplay -E3M6, E1M7, E2M6-; and, well, there are other less enjoyable -E2M2, E1M9-, or really bad -E3M7-. Finally, there's some maps based on real places... The first part of E2M1 is, for example, my old institute -long time ago...-; in the half of E3M7 appear some rooms of the bar of the village where I live; the first half of E2M7 shows part of a gym where I used to go... And other details like these.",
