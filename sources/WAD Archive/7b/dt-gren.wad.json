	"description": "Title says it all. These graphics originated in Shadow Warrior as well, but were seriously patched up by me. Standard grenade launcher type thing. It comes in two versions: MBF only, and all other engines. I suggest you use the MBF version, but if not, then you should use Doom Legacy. (looks cool) Replaces rocket launcher.",
