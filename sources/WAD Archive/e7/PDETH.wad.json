I tried to make these WADs a level higher than most of the other Wads I've seen out there. I kept the end level switches consistent throughout all the levels. LEVEL 1: a set of opposing fortresses with turrets Hints: Side turret bottoms open Wall behind chaingun in \"meatroom\" is a door Try the blue switches Level 2: Castle arena Hints: Center trap lasts 30 seconds Outside of center trap pillars open trap",
