	"description": "13 years of Doom doesn't have a consistent theme. It was just a project to get some of the mappers together to make a tribute to Doom style map. The map is built inside and around the letters \"13 YEARS OF DOOM\", with each letter made by different author. No, I don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean \"late\"? Anyhow, I'm not 100% sure of the credits, as the development cycle was rather long. Apologies to those who I may have forgotten. Have fun! It's never too late to celebrate Doom's 13th birthday!",
