Use Imagination :) HMP skill level is recommended for first run, UV may be too hard without learning all secrets. Secrets are vital part of the wad, so some tips on few secrets I don't want you to miss: -map 02 - Don't miss plasma rifle when you're in hurry. -map 04 - Look for strange wall to get supershotgun, chainsaw and some extra ammo. -map 05 - With yellow key obtained, do some backtracking to get such a good thing as backpack. Also, when you're done with the big spider, don't hurry to push exit switch - now you can pay back for map02 and get 100% of kills. And don't forget, automap is your friend :) P.S. Yes, 1st map is really small, go further. P.P.S. Works with vanilla, or at least with Chocolate Doom",
