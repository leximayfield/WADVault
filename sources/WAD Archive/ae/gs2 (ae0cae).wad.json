	"description": "This wad is designed for use with the new DEATHMATCH 2.0 rules. The wad consist in an area surrounded by an higher corridor. In the central area is situated a pool with fifteen lifts (good for hunting). The main area also includes miscellanous structures with some additional lifts to quickly go from a place to another one. I also included a small dark room. The only remaining weapons are shotguns, a chainsaw and a chaingun in order not to allow easy frags (but it's still bloody ;-) ). There's no monsters. At least this patch includes a new music from Van Halens, Jump.",
