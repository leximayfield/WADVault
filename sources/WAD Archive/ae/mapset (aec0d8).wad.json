	"description": "This is my first mapset for doom2. I have just started to learn doom builder and i know these levels isn't much to look at but i tried to make them fun and challening and i tried fixing as many bugs i could find so i hope there's none left but im not 100% sure. The maps: map 01: the lost base: A typical tech base level in the style of doom2 map01 and lightly inspired from doom1. It's supposed to be short and easy since its the first level. map 02: Halls of darkness. The second level is a little bit harder and is mostly tech base style but has an outside area and a toxic waste area to add more styles. map 03: Blood temple This one got more of a hellish theme and is much harder then map1 and 2 and also much bigger.",
