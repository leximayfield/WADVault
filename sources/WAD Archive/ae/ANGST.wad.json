	"description": "Deathmatch level designed for 2 players. My recommendation is that this level is played with alt-death (respawning weapons), and monsters (there is only one). All the weapons are incorperated into this wad, however, ammo is somewhat limited. Getting armour is quite a task if your opponent is an experienced deathmatcher. There are a lot of little hidding spots, windows, and a few secret walls for the less aggressive Deathmatchers.",
