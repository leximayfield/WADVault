	"description": "The missile launcher from Shadow Warrior, a cool game by 3dRealms. It replaces Doom2's rocket launcher, with some artistic license from myself, as usual. Only fires in one mode (no heat or nuke). Also, a cool new explosion, also from SW. NOTE: These graphics and sounds were included with dtcog30, but weren't implemented.",
