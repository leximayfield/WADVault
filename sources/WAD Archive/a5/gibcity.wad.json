	"description": "This Wad is large, well-made, very tuff, requires some thought to succeed but definitely isn't a 'puzzle box'!! Mostly, you gotta' figure out how you're gonna' kill stuff before it kills you. Lots of times you'll be forced to charge rather than flee. There are plenty of traps so you're gonna' have to think about that some too, This wad has been tested for playability with a goal of making it a stern test for the best players. You will feel like you've really accomplished something if you beat it fair and square. The wad features new sounds for weapons and some of the beasties. If you get as far as the first cyberdemon, he has a new, friendly greeting for you. There are FOUR cyberdemons (sorry) one big spider, and lots of archviles... as well as the usual baddies...As always with tuff wads, SAVE whenever some- thing good happens or you'll be an old guy before you finish up. Also, be cool with the ammo or you may find yourself with only bullets and a chainsaw to kill the TWO cyberdemons in the final arena! Try to save your plasma until you really need it, like whenever you find a Cyberdemon. A SUGGESTION: Don't go to the 'slime room' until you've finished the 'yellow key' section. Good luck... I welcome your feedback..wads can always get better...If you played \"Bruiser\" or it's twin \"Bruised\" and beat it, you may be ready for the 'turbo' version of that wad...It's lots tougher, with numerous monster and ammo 'upgrades', and very do-able for good players. E-mail me and I'll send it to you.",
