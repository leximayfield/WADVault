	"description": "Watch John W. Anderson (Dr Sleep) argue then execute Troop JB in his den in what proves to be an absolute classic argument. Original Voice Acting. This is my first wad ever with succesful scripting unlike The New Adventure which had its messages written on walls. The design of the maps is based on Dr. Sleep's style, since this is Dr. Sleep's Den anyway!. You simply stand there and watch em 'talk, etc. I'm expecing mixed reviews, but I don't care. A Bad Jokewad is a map of good level design and architecture, good Jokewads have horrible design, this one dosent unlike many.",
