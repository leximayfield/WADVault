	"description": "These are the first three maps of a megawad I work on, on and off, called \"Hybrid Awakening.\" I wanted to release the first three maps to the public to see if I am going in the right direction so far. The story is pretty sparse. Your a creation that wakes up in an underground lab. You have an electronic eye-patch (hud-face lol) and a katana nearby. The UAC is defunct and some new organization called \"Hybrid\" is up to no good, cloning demons and such. Naturally you have to go into their tech-base called the \"Kappa Tower\" and kick their asses. Good luck.",
