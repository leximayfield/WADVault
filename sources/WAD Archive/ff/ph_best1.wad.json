	"description": "Persephone is my first \"Best of\" episode, featuring 10 previously-released maps all in one modern package. MAP05 (The Leak) was subtly edited, SECRET1 (Twisted Joke) and MAP08 (Abandon All Hope) have had significant work done to integrate the sprite replacements they featured into a larger work and CREDMAP1 (The Cast and Crew) was extensively altered to reflect this WAD, rather than Scourge.",
