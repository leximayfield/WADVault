	"description": "Intense little PWAD! Play it and find out why I call it Slauterfest! Part of the reason is that the monsters are not deaf like they should be! The layout is intricately designed (I have an appreciation of good architechture). This is my first PWAD release, there will be more... ... I sort of rushed this for something to upload to keep my account... I promise the next one will be much better!",
