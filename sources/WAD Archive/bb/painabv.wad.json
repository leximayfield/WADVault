	"description": "A Hell-themed map that I originally created for a community megawad project. That project fell flat on its face, so I decided to keep the map as a stand-alone experience. This was the very first time I'd worked exclusively with this theme, so it was both challenging and a great learning experience. I believe this is one of my best maps yet, with non-linear gameplay and well-balanced difficulty.",
