	"description": "A DM map without any visual dazzlement or detail but with solid gameplay and flow. (So I'm told) The map layout is a long bean like main area (sector) connected to many outside higher sectors with lots of ledges and two raised walkways intersecting the central sector. If I ever complete Greenwar2, expect to see this wad in it. The name comes from a series of wads I started making around 2002 inspired from dwango5 map01.",
