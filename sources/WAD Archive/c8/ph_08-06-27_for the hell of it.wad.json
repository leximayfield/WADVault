	"description": "A large, varied map with a section inspired by StarWing (Star Fox, in a lot of the world), a Berserk-punching adventure, a base defence section and a scripted, wave-based boss fight. This is the infamous \"For The Hell of It\" that served as E2M0 (the secret level) in ZPack. It turns out that a ZDoom update had altered the way Radius_Quake worked, so I've fixed that as of 08/07/18.",
