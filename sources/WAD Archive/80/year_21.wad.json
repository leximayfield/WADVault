	"description": "At last, you've found the warp gate facility your superiors said was abandoned 21 years ago. Thank God they put you on leave, or else you'd have /never/ be able to find it! Stumbling over something on your way in, you open your way into a well-lit room with a large door... and the sounds of feasting behind it. Just then, you remember this base was abandoned for a reason... --- This is a speedmap that I did in ten hours on my 21st birthday, hence the first part of the title. Small and short, as can be expected, but it should be fun to play. Watch your health! This level uses textures from The Darkening Episode 2, Suspended in Dusk, and Nick Baker's Useful Flats pack.",
