I got a : bit of feedback from WHITROOM and CRESCENT : hope to hear some from this PWAD as well. : More shameless self-promoting: I also made : a music wad called ACTIOMUS (which has much : more appropriate music than the classical : music one that I made). I also have a graphic : file called SEQUENCE. All these are available : on ftp. Made on Doom version 1.666. A fairly good- : sized level (1300 vertices) taking advantage : of the power of doom to give you different : elevations (ledges, lifts, etc.) in a game. : Lots of switches and triggers.",
