	"description": "these were made for the Doom Wad Station project. but that megawad has made a huge change of direction, so these maps aren't really valid anymore. still, they are the best maps i've made thus far, so i desided i should release them in their own package. sense this also happened to be a 3 map wad, like my last release, i thought that maybe they should have a similiar name. anyway, hope you enjoy!",
