	"description": "In 2016 I decided to do a 20th anniversary rework of the original A1-SNiPE, for the sheer fun of it. SNiPE was started by Michael Davies, with the main building. We built the rest of the level around it as a collaborative thing. It's a pure deathmatch level, and probably one of the better levels I ever worked on. For some reason I waited another three years to finish this third version up, so it's a uh... 23rd anniversary edition I guess? Heh. I hope you like it.",
