	"description": "PWAD file for E1M1. This is an ARENA type DEATHMATCH level that was created using the same idea as the ledges series, with a central arena surrounded by smaller rooms. It is designed primarily for deathmatch, BUT can be played alone or co-op, but let me warn you that if you play with monsters, expect to get your butt kicked, especially in Ultra-Violence! There is only one gun of each type laying around not counting the shotgun you get from the enemies. HINT: There is a trick in one of the rooms that can become a 30 second trap for another player if you figure it out first!",
