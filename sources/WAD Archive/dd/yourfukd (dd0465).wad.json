	"description": "A \"in-your-face\" DEATHMATCH ONLY level. I've payed close attention to texture choice and alignment, weapon and ammo placment, & health placement. Also have placed various \"hidden\" teleporters so you can navigate the level quickly. Also have them placed so you can step off to the side of a hallway while being chased and appear behind your chaser. Most importantly this level is \"fun-to-play\" tested. So far four well seasoned network testers have all enjoed playing it. All weapons are included. I suggest -TURBO 200 as thats what its been play tested at.",
