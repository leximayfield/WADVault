	"description": "This is my first release. There is nothing fancy or exception about this map, I just made it to fit the original story line. The map is very large but not puzzling as a matter of fact it is almost straight foward but interesting. The real challenge is to play it on UV. Don't worry its not unbeatable. The secrets in it are not hard to find either. All in all I built this level for the purpose of it being a fast-pace action oriented map with lots of monsters. Try it.",
