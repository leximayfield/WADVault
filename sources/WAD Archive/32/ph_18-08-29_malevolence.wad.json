	"description": "A speed map which appeared as MAP09 of the 38th Abyssal Speed-Mapping Session. Restricted to only the monsters that were introduced in Doom II, this hellish map rewards a cautious player who takes the time to fully search the initial green brick area with plenty of supplies to take on the bigger hitters. I took a few cues from The Spirit World in places, as that was a potential theme for the session.",
