	"description": "After thinking of how cool wireframes are, I thought to myself: \"Gee, I wonder how would Doom look if the textures were made to look like they're wireframes!\" This is the result. As you've probably noticed, there are 3 colors of wireframe. Green are the normal walls. Red are used on textures often used for interactable things (namely: switches, doors, elevators). Lastly, blue ones are used on \"liquid\" textures, as they often are set to damage the player, so don't be surprised when a floor melts you. =P",
