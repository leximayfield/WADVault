	"description": "An entry for the Doom Republic Editing Contest. The theme is a dungeon and the amount of time given is a week, but I slacked off a bit and made it in about 4 days, so don't expect anything great. The map is 'supposed' to be a dungeon set in Hell but I got a bit carried away and I don't know what it is now. It also requires the Gothic Textures pack to run.",
