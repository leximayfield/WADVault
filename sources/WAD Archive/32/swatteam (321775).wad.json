	"description": "I got the idea for this while playing 3 player deathmatch, and secretly ganging up one player. Here you can play 2, 3, 4 player deathmatch. The level is of moderate size, consisting of a wide open area with a sniper tower, adjoining sewers, and an Armory building. Even though it's wide open in areas, there are many two-way exits from would-be corners, and there are a few places where you take a gamble going in, but the reward is large.",
