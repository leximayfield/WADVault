	"description": "Piggy, was designed for deathmatch. I hoped : that this wad would be used in the Lithium BBS : Tourney and also for our weekly frag fest ritual : at Matt's house. I also had to reclaim <<MY>> : wall textures. :) Four player mode will be sure : to produce plenty of frags in deathmatch 2.0, : and even more in 1.0. This wad should acuarately : judge two players' Doom skills on in a 1-on-1 : match, since all of the weapons are here and : there is plenty of room to fight. The plasma : gun is hard to get since this gun is responsible : for many deaths, but if you are playing in a two : on two situation, your friend can flip the switch : on the inside wall so you can warp out of the maze, : without getting trapped. Also notice how the : person picking up the plasma gun can't shoot out : under the ledge while standing on the platform.",
