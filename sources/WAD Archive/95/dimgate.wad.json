	"description": "The adventure begins in a Doom'd version of my office (not very detailed). From there, things get more and more bizarre. The level has several \"stages\", each separated by a transporter. There are a couple secret transporters and some neat affects where I try to get as close to true-3D (you can go under where you can go over). Some of these areas are a little confusing, but you can't get \"trapped\" anywhere.",
