	"description": "This wad contains replacement sprites for the Imp, it's a combination of that snake thing from Heretic and the Doom imp. I got the original idea from The Doom Beastiary (http://haunt.8m.com/beastiary/), more specific the Imp Serpent (on the imps page) created by Enjay. I didn't follow his design exactly, but the idea is similar, so I can't take credit for the design of this monster.",
