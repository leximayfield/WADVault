	"description": "Originally a map for Jimmy's Joy Of Mapping 5, I ended up pulling it as it had gotten too large and ambitious, and its size & length would have really bogged down what was already a hefty community project. This allowed me the chance to polish the map up to a higher standard, as the original JOM project limited mapping time to only 72 hours. Most of the map was done during that period, but more time was needed to re-do a couple areas and rework some progression, as well as complete detailing and thing placement. Funny that I get ~90% of this done in 3 days, then spend the next 4 months procrastinating on getting the rest done.",
