	"description": "These are my first published DOOM][ Levels. These levels have been designed for co-op playing. This means that single player is extremely difficult! I would suggest trying Hey I'm Too Young To Die if you want to play single player. These levels are based on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - Hall of the Fire Giant King (copyright TSR). There are three levels (maps 01-03) in all.",
