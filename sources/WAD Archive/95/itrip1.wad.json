	"description": "This was my second map, i have ever created. it\u00b4s a small map again, but tough. UV-MAX is not possible, because this should just be a speedrun level and nothing else. of course, you can play it also, in normal style, but it\u00b4s thought as a speedrun level. and i have made this level, before i have seen \"nuts.wad\" once in my life. so don\u00b4t compare it to that. this is no cheep copy. it\u00b4s a small, but good looking level. and he\u00b4s easier, then he looks. and the level is on map 28 for doom2, because of the music. NOTICE THAT THIS MAP JUST WORKS RIGHT UNDER ZDOOM. UNDER SOME OTHER PORTS, IT DOESN\u00b4T WORK CORRECTLY. BUT UNDER ZDOOM, EVERYTHING LOOKS AND WORKS RIGHT WITHOUT A PROBLEM. SO, PLAY IT JUST UNDER THAT PORT! THANKS!",
