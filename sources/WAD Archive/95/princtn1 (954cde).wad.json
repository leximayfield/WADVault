	"description": "This level was built using the actual floorplans of part of Wilson College, a dorm complex at Princeton University. The design features two large courtyards along with many of the dark hallways found in the buildings here. The dining hall is a particularly unpleasant area (both in this wad file and in reality.) For those familiar with Princeton, the buildings included are Clapp Hall, 1938 Hall, and Wilcox Hall.",
