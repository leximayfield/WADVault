	"description": "First WAD. Started July '94, finished November '94. All weapons but BFG. Spider Demon. Barneys, I mean Barons. This WAD has a distinct anti-Barney theme. For maximum enjoyment please use the Barney or Barney and Clinton patch. These important patches seem to have disappeared off the FTP sites so I include them in the ZIP file of AMBIENT. I have reached the exit in Ultra-Violent without cheating.",
