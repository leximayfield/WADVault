	"description": "It's dangerous out there... Four areas of a large base, each with it's own special 'feel'. Some monsters are to be destroyed, others might best be avoided. (The Cyber-Demon Lord comes to mind... ;) This is a difficult level, especially the first time through. It IS possible to beat it though. All weapons are provided, here and there, and there is plenty of ammo lying around. You don't HAVE to find all the keys as there are secret (and not so secret, if you can get past the cyber lord) doors that will let you get from section to section without going through the 'key' doors. There are lots of secret rooms and many of the doors are not obvious. Nose around. Play time averages around 20 minutes for me. (If you know where the secret's are and don't bother to hunt for 'things' or kill stuff you can get from start to finish in three minutes) Probably be closer to 40+ for someone who doesn't know the way around. (You should especially enjoy the 'maze'... I still get lost in there and I BUILT the damned thing!:)",
