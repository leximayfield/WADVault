	"description": "Deathmatch is the central design theme in this PWAD. Detail was paid to the layout and different playing styles encountered during deathmatch play. The winner will be the best player - not the luckiest or the one who can guard key positions. There are no invulnerable places to sit and wait. There are a few tricks, puzzles, and hidden stuff. Above all, this PWAD was designed to have fun fragging friends. (say that ten times fast).",
