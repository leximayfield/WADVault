	"description": "This level is my first, and as such was designed to demonstrate an idea I had to simulate 3D play by silencing the teleporter and making the destination look like the jump point. Once I demonstrated that it worked I made a hardcore shotem' up because my roomates complained that DOOM is too easy. The level lacks a \"motif\" and I was lazy with the textures but if you have time to notice you must be a DOOM GOD. An included file toughguy.bat replaces the nessesary sounds & graphics, plays the game (with added extensions) then restores on exit. To play unzip all files to your DOOM dir and type \"toughguy\". The bat file calls DMGRAPH & DMAUD so you'll need them too.",
