	"description": "ABOUT THE TOTAL WAR III EXPERIENCE: To play the new level, type REoLDOOM to start total chaos! This is probably one of the weirdest DOOM levels you may ever had played! There are soooo many weird effects and illusions you may have thought would be IMPOSSIBLE to do (if you're a DOOM level maker your- self)! The effects you will see start right in the beginning! A door in the middle of the starting area! You'll also see doors coming out of the sky, dark rooms you can see fine in (it doesn't make sense at all, doesn't it? Well, it was done. You'll be suprised!), and get this, INVISABLE BUILDINGS! You may see the doors (sometimes), and maybe the windows, but you don't see a building attatched! The \"pancake syndrome\" is also cleared up (flat outer retaining walls, and unflattened entry- ways can be seen BEYOND the walls, to show thickness, unlike E3M1). Some \"flatness\" is around, but that's because there are invisable buildings around. Invisable doors leave \"slices\" or voids in the wall, or the top of the wall. One neat DOOM effect is the Hall Of Mirrors. One room has this effect in it's windows. This is NO screw-up. It's done on PURPOSE! The \"teleporting theory\" found in the real E3M7 is also in here, but with a different twist. All I'm going to say is that it's harder to do (heh, heh, heh!). Also, be carefull of a few nasty areas! There are five areas where you'll be fighting very hard! You won't be fighting as hard as in TOTAL WAR II, E1M2, but it's quite a nasty brawl!",
