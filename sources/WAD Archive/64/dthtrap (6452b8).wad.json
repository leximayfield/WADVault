	"description": "I think the name says it all. Its playable but tough. This was an experiment in building a simple level that would be dangerous and make the most of a player's skills. It may be easier to play cooperatively, and deathmatch will be deadly. Warning! The monsters have free travel and may come through the wallsat you! Tons of ammo included.",
