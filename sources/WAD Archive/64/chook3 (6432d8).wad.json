	"description": "Imagine your wandering around hell or earth depending on Which DOOM ya wanna play with and all of a sudden a 6 foot tall chicken jumps out at you and starts throwing eggs at you. Then you whip out you Chook launching cross bow and blow the sucker away. This Rather funny patch replaces player sprites, imps with taller than usual chooks, replaces lost souls with flying chooks, replaces the soldiers with kangaroo's, replaces 4/8 weapons, has 5 new death match levels as well as heaps of sounds and music. The 5 deathmatch levels included absolutely rock and have had _MANY_ hours of play testing, and they are a million times better with Chook DOOM 3.0 :)",
