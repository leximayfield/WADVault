	"description": "I made this level sometime in '96. It's one of my earliest levels that wasn't lost or deleted. I was very happy with this map when it was finished. Playing it now, well, it has its moments but overall it's a silly place. The ending is rather stupid, after getting the blue key hit the switch next to the blue door then go back past the red skull barriers, a teleporter will have opened to your left. It takes you a room with three switches, the one near the dead marine will open a small room, I think you have to enter the room to open the blue exit door. It's dumb I know, don't ask what I was thinking.",
