	"description": "You can complete this level without God Mode, it is difficult but it can be done; you'll probably have to save it a few times. There are areas with energy and ammo, make sure you enter them; you'll need them. Really for single player only. ***********************GAME DESCRIPTION*********************** I'm not really sure what the theme is, let alone what to name it. It's a fun level and I think most Doomers should enjoy iplaying it. Just enjoy the effects and scenery.",
