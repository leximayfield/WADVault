	"description": "Well, um, I think the title sums it up right? ;) Seriously, the level is fairly simple (like most of my levels) consisting of an outside playing field and a central tower with no interior lighting that contains the more powerful weapons. The most power- ful weapon (depending on the skill level) is positioned on one high end of the arena, which is reachable by a risky teleport on the opposite side of the arena.",
