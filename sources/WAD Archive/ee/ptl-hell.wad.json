	"description": "This is my first level for Doom2 and I think it came out pretty good. You are stuck inside a marble fortress and you must clean it out and escape. Once you find the Portal to Hell, you are in for a massive fight. Good luck!. This is quite a large level with over 400 monsters on UV so be very careful.",
