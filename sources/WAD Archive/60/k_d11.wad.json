	"description": "Darrell Esau http://www.itslab.calpoly.edu/~desau/ In Dreadnaught you are Kane, an immortal who was doomed to roam the Earth by the god that created you. The punishment levelled at you for killing your own brother and thus brought terrible violence to the Earth. The irony is that the god was a corrupt and cynical part of the supernatural universe overruling Earth and you, Kane, rebelled against being used as a pawn. Your adventures take place in all ages of Earth. Your sword and battle prowess is at the service of any ruler who can pay your price. You are a true anti-hero who changes sides to suit your own advantage and mood. You never age and remain as old as you were when the god cursed you. You can be killed but up to now no human has come close to doing so.",
