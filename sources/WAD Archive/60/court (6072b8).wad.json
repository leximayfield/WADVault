	"description": "The Courtyard is designed for multiplayer Deathmatch! There is no monsters to interupt you from crushing your opponent(s). There are a lot of places to shoot from and some one-way walls to hide behind. All the weapons (minus the shotgun, but who needs it when you have the Super-shotgun!) but the BFG & Rocket Launcher aren't to easy to get, that is with-out leaving yourself open to the other players!",
