	"description": "This is the result of one working week of attempting to make complete maps in the shortest possible time. Each map was made in about one afternoon. The result is an episode of 5 small monster filled levels, which I find challenging to play. I imagine these maps will appeal to players who apreciate older more challenging maps, but keep in mind the amount of time spent making the maps does show in their quality.",
