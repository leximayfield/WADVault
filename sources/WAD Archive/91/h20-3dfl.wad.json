	"description": "While testing out DOOM Legacy's 3-D water and 3-D floors I thought, \"Can you have BOTH?! Nah...\" but tried it anyway. The result: a room, with a real basement filled with water! You can swim around in it of course, and go to the room with the BFG which I modeled after a similar section in Quake II's 1st level. The teleporter can be entered at any height if you're swimming into it. AND, push the switch and the water drains!! =) Also the nukage pool in front of you when you start will hurt you while you swim in it. If I had just tagged the actual sector itself to hurt you, you'd only get hurt when standing on the bottom, not when swimming.",
