	"description": "A big fan of M.C. Escher, what a genius. I have tried my best to make a quality wad, with enough escher and escherish stuff in it. I tried not to put to much stuff in it so it wouldn't be too large or too slow. What good is a wad if you can't deathmatch 4-way on it - quick! Design is kept fairly simple to insure a good playing speed and plenty of frags.",
