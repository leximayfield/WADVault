	"description": "With the apparent downfall of DOOM due to the recent release of Quake, or at least the alpha version (but I think even that's better than DOOM), I'm going to stop making DOOM ][ levels. From now on, all my levels are going to be for Quake. But that doesnt mean I won't continue the fear series. Fear III will be a Quake level, and will be truly amazing (so long as I understand how the hell CAD works :)",
