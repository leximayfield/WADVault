	"description": "A just-for-fun level. It doesn't follow any story or pattern, just fun. It's moderate in size, and can be pretty challenging in Ultraviolence I think. This is my first WAD that I've uploaded, but I've made many before this one that I just haven't uploaded, so I've had some experience anyway. What else can I say, except try it and enjoy.",
