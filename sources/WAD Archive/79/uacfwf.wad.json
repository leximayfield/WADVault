	"description": "This is my first DOOM map, and it's based heavily on the First World Bank map, featured in both PAYDAY: The Heist and PAYDAY 2. The spawn area, some of the outdoors area, the underground area past the blue key, and the hell area are my own design. The rest is based on the original map. Been playing DOOM since I was a little kid, finally wanted to try my hand at a map, so here we go!",
