	"description": "Another invasion of the hellspawn had some nasty surprises. The demons of Hell brought a flesh-like substance which quickly started corrupting a nearby city. Last week a squad of marines was sent to investigate the area and destroy the source of infection. Unfortunately, the contact went down 5 days later. You are tasked to destroy the source of substance...or at least get out alive to tell everything to the government.",
