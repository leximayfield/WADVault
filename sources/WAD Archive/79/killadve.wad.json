	"description": "This is an all new a 32 level episode for doom2. You must adventure through many unique worlds killing awful monsters along the way. When you play this in Zdoom you get all the level names. I learnt how to use mapinfo, add new textures and add new music. The first 11 levels are on the ground and then you go into space before heading into a vivid colorful world of beauty. Many arch guys and barons and blue enemies and demons will try and stop you but you have plenty of firepower to protect you. It took me 4 months to make this and I back this up on my memory card everytime I made a level. Thailand monsoon lightning struck powerline and my laptop was fried but got it replace with warranty. After that I finish off the Killing Adventure and I drew the pictuers and the titlepic and got it scanned at my cousins house. Took me 3 hours to figure out but got it into doom finaly. I hope you enjoy the killing adventure and I also made the skys too.",
