	"description": "This is my first attempt at a pwad. SLUDEAD is a pwad (very loosely) based on the design of the SLU medical school. No new graphics or sounds yet, but are planned in future versions. Just a word of advice; CONSERVE your ammo because there isn't much excess. Look for hidden rooms by checking the map. All the weapons are there except the BFG.",
