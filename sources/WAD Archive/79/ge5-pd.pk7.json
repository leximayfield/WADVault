	"description": "Bet you never thought you'd see this, eh? The next installment in the Gateway Experiments series, just in time for Doom's 22-and-a-halfth-ish Anniversary. Where's episodes 2, 3, and 4? Well, I'm not making them. I've done a George Lucas, skipped a few chapters, and tweaked Space Station Omega slightly so that it could fit in this package with the new stuff.",
