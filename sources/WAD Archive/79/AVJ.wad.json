With some time getting into this, this will make fun for each kind of player. The aim of this wad is to complete the maps by especially using Arch-Vile-Jumps, which describes the vertical boost of an Arch-Vile-Attack, and Rocket-Jumps without getting killed. In map32 you also have to kill monsters because they will distract you from jumping through the map.",
