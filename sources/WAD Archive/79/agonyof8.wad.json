	"description": "A rather large map featuring spacious, open-air environments, a dark cave system below, and a river. It'sabout a twelve minute affair if you know exactly what you're doing. Speedrunning was not a consideration while making this level, and you can make it to the exit without killing a monster in no time at all. Please tell me if you enjoy this level! I have more on the way. :)",
