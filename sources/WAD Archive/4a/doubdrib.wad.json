	"description": "\"Double Dribble\" was the name of a comedy duo in a hentai manga by Akira Ozaki I've read this year. I wanted a name with \"double\" in it to reference the theme of paired doors in this map. So I remembered this one and decided to use it as I've always thought it was cute. Anyway, this is a classic style nonlinear 3 key affair. It uses a combination of snipers, roaming monsters, traps and medium health starvation to challenge the player in a (hopefully) exciting way. Personally, I quite like how it turned out.",
