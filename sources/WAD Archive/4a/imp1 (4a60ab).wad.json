Yes in this first level, you must stop those pesky imps from draining the powers of the Barons of Impania, and to do that, you must infaltrate the Imp Base and steal the keys.. then, break into the temple, which has been taken over by the few survivors of this war (The demons), and defeat the barons. To prove that this WILL be an episode, I have included screen shots of the upcoming level: THE QUEEN IMP!.",
