	"description": "This is a compilation of the WADs entered in SargeBaldy's fourth speedmapping exercise. Participants were given 100 minutes to create a Doom 2 level on a certain theme. This week's theme was to create an ep4-style hellish map, but do so making the design vaguely reminiscent of Central Processing (E1M6).",
