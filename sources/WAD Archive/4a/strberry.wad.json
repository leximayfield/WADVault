	"description": "Are you looking to play a Nostril Caverns inspired level from me? Here you have it: Strawberry Caverns. It consists mostly of red and some green, resembling a strawberry. You go through a series of corridors, killing enemies, and activating switches. After you activate the switches, arch-viles teleport and you have to activate more switches until the exit opens. Unlike Nostril Caverns, this level is not a giant circle. Rather, it is a series of corridors on 2 sides. Expect a typical gameplay to be 3-4 hours.",
