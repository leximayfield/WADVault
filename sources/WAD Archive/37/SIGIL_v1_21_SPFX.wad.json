	"description": "This WAD fixes the incorrect aspect ratio on the Christopher Lovell artwork included in SIGIL. Said graphics are now no longer improperly stretched vertically by 20%. These fixes are compatible with both the SIGIL_v1_21.wad and SIGIL_COMPAT_v1_21.wad versions of SIGIL. Simply load SIGIL_v1_21_SPFX.WAD after either one.",
