	"description": "This level is somewhat advanced in terms of navigating around in it. However, the path is rather linear and will relatively fast lead you around the map its size considdered. There is a lot of switches to be found, however only in a couple of places do they activate a remote placed lift, door etc. It is also a relatively long walk from the when you first spot the Blue Key untill you can actually pick it up. Again, just follow the path and you will eventually get it.",
