	"description": "Actually this is my first deathmatch level ever. I started it as a tech/base style level. Later I decided to experiment a bit and I completely changed the texturing while keeping the lay-out pretty much intact. It is now a hellish/medieval style level. A bit like the original id episode 4 levels. Thanks should go to Matt Dixon for giving me useful tips for item placement. Oh, I made a single player version of this level too that might show up in a future release ...",
