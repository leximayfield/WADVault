	"description": "This is the long awaited sequel and triquel for WOW.WAD. The story is short, the spiderdemon went into a pit and couldn't get up. There he thought, I'll just guard this red key and bfg and wait for the Doom marine to get me back up. Meanwhile the cyberdemon found a very similar installation in a gross place. The cyberdemon was curious about the pit and dropped there, and he also was unable to come back up and stayed there. He was also guarding a red key and a bfg. Your job is to find them, get them back up, kill them, get the red keys and bfgs. After you've done your job you can entertain yourself and your friends in these installations and have a nice deathmatch. They're so small, you can't get lost or hide from your buddies :) Now get fraggin!",
