We mapped for about 3.5 hours, followed by about 30 minutes of testing and bug fixes. I didn't finish in time, so I went back later for another hour of work. UV will kill you a few times; HMP is a much easier, more casual experience. Uses textures from Jimmy and a sky from Mech. Midi \"Boss\" comes from Fester's Quest NES game.",
