Life is going pretty easy, until a message from Earth HQ reaches you: There's a spy hiding somewhere around in the place, possibly in disguise. So now you, as the pro killer, have to eliminate this guy...this looks promising, right? Just get yourself a shotgun and start firing! (Remember, I'm not responsible for any quarrels that might occur when deciding who's the spy and who's the \"good guy\"!) :)",
