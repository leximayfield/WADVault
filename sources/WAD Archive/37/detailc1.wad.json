	"description": "WARNING: THIS MAP IS A SEMI-JOKEWAD IT HAS NO GAMEPLAY VALUE AT ALL This is my first released map, however iv known how to map for a while now. I could never finish a map properly, id spend so much time then id end up deleting it. I wanted to try to make something on a smaller scale. Not a 1024 map, but something unique. I thought \"what is the most common thing a newbie mapper does in there first map\" a Large Square map with 100 BFGs 100 Invuls and 100 Cyberdemons with a few SS guys thrown in... I figured that i could do the very same, yet actually put some effort into making the map look half decent. So the map was born, i used textures and sprites from a Blood themed project i was planning to do, but never got off the ground. I also used music from the pack of unused doom music tracks that John Romero released some time ago and a new sky from somewhere i cant remember. Again, this does not offer any kind of gameplay value, but maybe someone will get a laugh out of though.",
