	"description": "Well, remember dark caliber project that was hyped by Ellmo (Hello there leader faggot), you know, we worked on this decently and there was map02 done by ellmo, BUT NO, he said he will start programming and that i should remove his map under request, why!? so yeah, project was pretty much crumbled. I decided to tune up and finish all of the maps i created for this wad, about 3 maps which differ in difficulty (Map01 - easy, Map02 - Normal, Map03 - Hard). I'm sure you will enjoy it but be aware that playing map03 on UV may piss you off and cause a trauma or depression, play at your own risk on UV ;) happy holidays doom masters",
