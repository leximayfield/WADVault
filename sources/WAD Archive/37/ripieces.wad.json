	"description": "Rest in Pieces is the first true complete DOOM 2 level that I have completed. However, don't let this put you off. This *really* has everything and is very difficult. Secret rooms, all weapons (except BFG, that would make it too easy,) just enough ammo if you play carefully. Dark corridors, big arenas, secret teleports, overwhelming odds (or is it?!) and you have to retrace your steps but be warned! things will have changed.",
