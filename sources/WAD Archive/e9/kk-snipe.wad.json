	"description": "Well, I haven't done a WAD for a while coz one I was working hard on and looked really kewl stuffed up! Noooo! :( So I stopped creating WADs (This was after I did A1-SNIPE) Then one day, AsM had given me the suggestion to do a sequel to A1-SNIPE, so I started with some scrawling on paper, and this is the result! :) Set 1000 years after A1-SNIPE, there has been a land slide, and the new city you built around 500 years ago (Shesh you live a bloody long time for a human! Wowies! :) has had a lot of dirt chucked on top of it. Oops. You then get really angry about this and decide to go on a killing spree against your fragpals. Don't you just LOVE gratuitous violence? >:-)",
