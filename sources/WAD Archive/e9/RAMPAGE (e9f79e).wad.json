	"description": "Here's a nice, complete reconstruction of the office where I work here in San Francisco. Now when I get mad I don't have to just sit around and steam until I finally snap and go on a real rampage -- I can do it at home! And so can you! Just pretend your co-workers and friends have been turned into evil creatures and it's easier to open up on 'em! Anyway, this wad is here so you can vent your frustration in an air-conditioned and target-rich environment. It's especially good for deathmatch , with lotsa nooks and crannies for your point-blank shotgun dueling enjoyment. I won't tell you where this office is because I wouldn't feel safe knowing that there will be a lot of people out there who can wipe the place out in their sleep! Enjoy!",
