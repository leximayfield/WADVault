	"description": "This is my third ewad. This is a wide open area with a ledge running around the entire outside with a large shrine in the center. There is a lot of water here so you have to be a good aim with the Firemace or it will splash in the water and disappear on inpact. There are several levels, but they are the same so there can be a variety of skies and musics.",
