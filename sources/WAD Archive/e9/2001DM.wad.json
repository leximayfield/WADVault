	"description": "The precursor to 2001 A Doom Odyssey. 2001 A Deathmatch odyssey consists of 8 deathmatch levels that replace Episode 1. Music included is a random selection of songs which will be used in the full 2001 A Doom Odyssey megawad. These levels are designed for -altdeath play, without it weapons won't respawn and Ammo will run out. Style of the levels differ alot from dark, dirty to clean and hi-tech. E1M8 was only my third paper planned level. Works with Doom 1 version 1.666 or over. V1.9 or sourceport recomended.",
