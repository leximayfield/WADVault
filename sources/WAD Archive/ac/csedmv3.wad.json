	"description": "This is yet another upgrade in the CSEVIL series, and it is the best, so far... Lots of new places to go and explore. VERY awesome Death Match. Every room links into the main room, plus another room, so there are NO dead ends, which greatly enhances Death Match. There's like, a two player exit, so you can't beat it alone. The first part is behind the BFG staircase in a room. That switch will lower a lift which is behind a door near the rotating body pillar. In there, is a switch which opens the exit door, which is marked by a sign. The first (or another player) must then go in the room and hit the almighty switch. If you want to beat it in single player mode, there is a secret passage into the exit, which is blocked by torches in multi-player. This will probably be the last upgrade of this level in terms of major map changes, but a new version made for DOOM Gore v3.0 will be out soon...",
