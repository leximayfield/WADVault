	"description": "This is a DEATHMATCH ONLY wad. It must be played under DEATHMATCH 2.0 rules. It is based on a flying arena with a few extra areas and tricks thrown in. If you do not use DEATHMATCH 2.0 rules, you will quickly run out of wings to fly with. There is an exit, but I threw in a Maulotaur to remind you that that should only be entered when everyone is ready.",
