	"description": "The level is that of a castle with a church. I made a gulliatine, a gallows pole and a stake burning. I spent a while making every texture aline perfectly.

I tried to make a pretty level that played well and I think I accomplished that... If anyone has any ideas that I could add on just E-mail me...",
