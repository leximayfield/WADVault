	"description": "Level 1: This is an edited level 1..This still has the feeling of level 1 too.. Level 2: This level is probably my favorite...Its not too big, not too small..It even looks good.. Level 3: This is a small, quick frag level..There are a few secrets to it...try and find em.. Level 4: This is a wad a friend made...I did the textures though..Be careful that if you hit the light switch, that you can find your way back.. Level 5: This is my first level ever made.. (ROOSTER.WAD) i went and added a few more stuff. basically cleaned it up.. Level 6: This level is made for 4 player..it can be played with 2 players, but its a little too wide open... Level 7:Ryan made this level..its his first attempt at a wad...he did pretty good....I helped out with some of the textures though..",
