This one has a LOT to offer in the way of secret areas, LOTS of guns/ammo (Every gun is in the level at least twice), and WIDE open areas for shooting each other. This map may appear to be sort of small, but that's because I opened it up (After trying it w/ all the doors, it was boring because there was no way to sneak up on anyone.)",
