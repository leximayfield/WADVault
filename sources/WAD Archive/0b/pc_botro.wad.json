	"description": "The first of my tuneup maps. This was my first ever level. Originally made way back in 1996. I have decided to give it a major facelift. The entire map has been retextured into a bricks and metal theme (Dr. Sleep like) and looks and plays a ton better than the original. Uses 100% stock textures. The original version of this map can be found in MAP31 of my 2006 Jokewad The New Adventure (0cb.wad). I named this map Botero's mansion. Botero = Spanish for Boatman.",
