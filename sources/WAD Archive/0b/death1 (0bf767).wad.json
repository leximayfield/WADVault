	"description": "Lots of level ideas I had incorporated into a Deathmatch level. It differs from most Deathmatch levels that I've seen in that it has multiple weapon locations (somewhat preventing a player from hanging out near one), a few traps that allow for alternate killing methods, and a means to permanently cut off the route to the BFG if it becomes too annoying (be careful of what switch you hit). It also has a few really good hiding places (if you can find them) and lots and lots of ammo. IT IS NOT PLAYABLE AS A SINGLE PLAYER LEVEL! It has a coop exit and no monsters, but there is a player one start point so you can look at it. This is my second level.",
