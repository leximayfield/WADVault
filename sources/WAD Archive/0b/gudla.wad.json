The whole level is like red bricks and is very hot with lotsa slime passagewayes. Unlike my older levels this one uses the same texture everyiwhere and is a bit of a maesz in places to your knowlege. Your mission is to get the blue key in a red level and get the hell outta here to the spirit world.",
