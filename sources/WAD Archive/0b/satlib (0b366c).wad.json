	"description": "You've always hated your local librian. She makes even Rossanne look small and undernourished. Apart from the fact that she is well, some what large she also is very mean and horrible <oh no :) >. However, during one of your visits you notice a strange _gurgle_ sound coming from the toilet. You are reading a large book titled 'One billion and one ways to crash Microsoft Windows' and the noises begin to disturb you. Annoyed you burst into the cubicle. The sight before your eyes is probably the most digusting known to man. The librarian is litterally stuck to the toilet seat! \"Help me!!, the toilet is eating me!!\" she pleads.",
