	"description": "This is a set of pretty difficult DOOM II wads BUT!, they are all possible, even starting with just a pistol and a few shells. The few bits of secret are there just to help, they're not essential. The main key to finishing these wads is discretion! Don't go running around like a headless Imp, and don't try killing the Cyber Demons or the Spider Demons. Every level contains all the weapons EXCEPT THE BFG - this is for big puffs! Take 'em on with a shot gun!!",
