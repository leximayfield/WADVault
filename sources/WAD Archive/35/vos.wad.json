	"description": "Watched by towering monuments to the greatest of D'Sparil's disciples, the Valley of Saints is full of certain death to any heretic that dare enter. Never the less, it is your quest to reach the chapel at the summit of the cliff and destroy the evil within. Following an ancient cavern passage, you ready your wand and prepare to enter the valley.",
