	"description": "High/Low 2 is a Doom Episode 2 themed level. Like High/Low 1, which was an episode 1 kinda level it is only meant to resemble the style, not to copy it. That is basically my general vision for this small series. The next level will resemble a Doom 2 level like Industrial Zone, Downtown, The Factory etc. For a bit more accurately themed Eps. 2 level, I suggest that you also play my \"Rip it, Tear it Smash it!\". Now that's good stuff! :-)",
