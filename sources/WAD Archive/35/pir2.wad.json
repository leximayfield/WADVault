	"description": "PIR2 is 32 levels designed specifically for co-op play with my grandson. The levels are all fairly small, and packed with as much health, ammo and monsters as I could cram in. It gets boring running around in the dark trying to figure out the maze when there's no monsters left. That ain't gonna happen in these wads. Have all the fun you can, and if you can't BE CAREFUL!... --bp",
