In cooperative mode you all start out in a safe room where you can see each other & then get tactics sorted out Then watch out! Pity the poor player two! Something has gone wrong!! Where are you buddy?!?! You must be stingy with ammo & health. I didn't see any reason writing a level that was too easy. After all, if you're going to play an external level then you MUST be an experienced player. If you want more ammo & health then play on Hurt Me Plenty. Enjoy!",
