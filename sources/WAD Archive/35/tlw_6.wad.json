	"description": "The Original Lost WAD floppy disc was dusty. It had inches of dust on it. So, I decided to re-vamp the original, and make it up to date. Well, nevertheless, this is NOT The Lost WAD #1! This level's is based on the first. This is about three times bigger with better traps. I'd ask anyone who plays this to download the original and check out the two side by side.",
