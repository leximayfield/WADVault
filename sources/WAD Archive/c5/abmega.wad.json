	"description": "This is just a collection of maps I've abandoned in my attempt to make a Megawad. =.=''' So I make those into a Megawad. Playable, but expect absolute random themes, horrible textures, random monsters, random stuffs all over the random maps. But do expect some interesting maps that might be better than a few other maps around. Winks! Oh! And expect maps with repeated sections as I might have copied a section or two from maps to maps, but no 2 maps are identical. Expect a few harder maps between sets of simple smaller maps as well.",
