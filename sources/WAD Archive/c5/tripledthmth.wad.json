	"description": "MAP03 - The inside is dark to provide a mystery effect and have a hard time to get a good kill yet there is light amplification goggles hidden in the area while the outside provides some duck and cover aspects. MAP04 - Everything in this map basically happens fast and one might want to act quick since this is more of less an open area where anything is plausible . . . . . Even kill steals. You better kill or you are going to be killed. MAP05 - There are several chambers and several open areas where multiple mini-DM's are able to occur. Please be advised that the fast-paced of the map will be subsequent to each death pertained to a specific character. I do not know what that sentence is supposed to mean yet those who do, please keep on DM'ing. Overall - These three maps, in conjunction with my other two maps, will provide with enough DeathMatch time that everyone will find that these maps will bring peace and happiness to the world (yea, right. But they will provide great fragging rights once everything is over.) ~Enjoy",
