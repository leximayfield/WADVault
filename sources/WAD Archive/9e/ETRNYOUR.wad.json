	"description": "This concludes the Doom Core trilogy. Eternally Yours is an 11-map episode that should work for vanilla Doom. I would say the levels work better playing from pistol start to avoid having too much for the next level, but that's your decision. Anyway, I hope you enjoy playing them as much as I did making them. ~Mike",
