	"description": "A wham-bam, bippity-boppin' good Time wreakin' havoc among them Satanic civies and mutated meatheads. Watch your step and ALWAYS watch your back. It's not an impossible level and is quite solvable within a couple of tries. Well, maybe. Swap some lead. *** II *** There are no mechanical differences between my first release and this release. In this release I improved Y alignment, changed some textures, and added a few more dead bodies here and there. If you happen to have the first release, you probably got it from one of my friends. This wad is the first of a pseudo episode 4 series. Play difficulty is at least as difficult as the mid-episode 3 levels when set to ultra-violence.",
