	"description": "Sniper 0.1 is my first attempt at a big wad and I hope veryone enjoys it. It will be part of another whole series, with added sounds, music, and maybe added sprites. Please send any comments to Grizzlebrach@hotmail.com. Any way its a large castle with a few puzzles, may require two people unless yer fast! Singler player good! Deathmatch, maybe 4 people.",
