	"description": "Well, maybe it's wrong to call this a demo, it's more like a HD-cleaning. It was close that these 2 levels were lost in my last reformat, I remembered to upload them the very last minute. Since it's not likely that I will work on this megawad- project anytime soon I might just as well release these levels standalone. The difficulty is balanced so that skill 4 is not playable or fun in any way, so don't bother trying it unless you are a masochist.",
