	"description": "One new level with a hellish theme, similar to bits of Episode2 and Episode3. This was originally supposed to be a contribution for DarkHaven's megawad project which was codenamed X-DOOM... Sadly, that project died, despite the fact that my map for it got finished. So I've decided to release it now as a separate add-on, cause otherwise I would've felt like I wasted too many productive hours for absolutely nothing.",
