	"description": "As Hell has taken over the earth, much of the urban areas have been compiled as part of Dis, the fabled city of the damned. This is the first part in a series of levels taking you on a tour of Dis. The library of Dis is set on an island in the river of Acheron, and is top-heavy with administrative personnel in need of 'retirement'. The other levels in the series will be posted when completed. This level looks large, but it should still be small enough for deathmatch purposes, probably best played with 3 or 4 players.",
