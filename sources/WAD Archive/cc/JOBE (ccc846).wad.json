	"description": "Since this was my first level, it contains a bit of everything. Traps, a few constructions, I came up with and experiments with light levels and effects. Thus, it is quite linear and therefore probably not very suited for deathmatch. But I haven't tried so far... Well, I don't like the level anymore, after playing it over and over again, so it is time to release it. Hope you enjoy it!",
