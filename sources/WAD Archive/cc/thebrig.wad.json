	"description": "A very large single-player/deathmatch wad. You've been thrown into the brig again, for the routine incident of assaulting a commanding officer. As luck would have it, the prison comes under assault by the aliens as you are sleeping in your bunk. Of course, what could wake you from a good night's sleep? Nothing. So..in the morning, you wake up at your own accord to find a ravenous zombie bending over to take a bite out of your neck. You frown and quickly twist off its head, then grab the pistol it was carrying, along with a few full clips. You look around to find your fellow cellmates mutilated beyond recognition. You think to yourself \"Shit..I gotta stop taking those sleep pills.\" Rumors that you've heard from long-timers bring up the fact that this place is not just a prison, but so much more...Welp, time to haul ass and bust out of this slaughterhouse.",
