Pullen (marcpullen@comcast.net) Album Title : Doomed Released : 2016-08-04 (Aug 4) Where can I get the highest quality tracks from? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJjPllsAjrs https://soundcloud.com/marcpullen/sets/marc-a-pullen-doomed The OGG versions in this WAD can be reused/extracted/remixed for whatever you want, free of charge. Just mention my name in your credits, that's all! The OGG versions are slightly lower quality, so please grab the highest quality WAVs from my SoundCloud url above if you want to redistribute these. I don't mind if you want to redistribute the music, just grab the best sounding ones please. You can also direct people to using this WAD for music in your project.
