	"description": "A mandala is an eastern painting or art piece, usually circular in motif with a central point of origin. It is used as a cognitive centering device for meditation. The idea is to immerse yourself in the art work, which in the process would bring you to a space where you can overcome your \"demons,\" so to speak, and come to some resolution. When I first saw Doom, I knew it would be a perfect place to put a Mandala in... demons, resolution to higher levels and immersion.... \"Man the Mandala\" is my first attempt at playing with this concept. I use some eastern symbolism interspersed with some very western ones, which may or may not be obvious. At any rate, it certainly is a lot more fun and immediate than sitting in a lotus position, following your breath to point on a painting on a wall...which can be fulfilling, but is certainly a hell of a lot more work and not necessarily fun!",
