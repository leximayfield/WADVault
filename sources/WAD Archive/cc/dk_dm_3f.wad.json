	"description": "Greetings Deathmatch fanatics! I've slaved over Doom Builder yet again and constructed 12 more deathmatch maps for some fun fresh fragging. These ones are a bit different than my older maps, I went in with the goal of creating some really powerful, replayable layouts. The better you know the turf, the better you'll do in game - There are lots of secrets and hidden bonuses.",
