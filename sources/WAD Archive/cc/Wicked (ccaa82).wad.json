	"description": "The wad improves the deaths of most of the enemies in Doom2. The new deaths are much more inventive and gory than the originals. Just take the chainsaw to the guys in the first room of level1 to see a good example of what I'm talking about. Not like most of the cheap fakey gore patches out there.",
