	"description": "Pretty large replacement level for E1M1. Absolutely huge room in the SE corner, heh heh. If it's too hard for ya, try reducing the difficulty level... sissy. :) I left most of secret areas shown as yellow on the map... makes it a little more possible to spot 'em. In UV mode save often... :) This is my first stab at applying creativity towards DOOM. Pretty good, if I say so myself... hope you think so too. Also, I hope everyone has a real copy of DOOM by now, thus the E1M1 replacement. (I figure the release of DOOM II & Heretic has kinda outdated the original.)",
