	"description": "A multiplayer co-op map in which up to four players fight against a horde of heads (the author's head and that of my roommate's.) Gameplay is round based, with life and ammo recovering between rounds. There are 2 alternate modes of play and 4 player classes to choose from. Map is balanced for 3 or 4 players, but will still run fine with 1 or 2.",
