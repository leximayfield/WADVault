There are several reasons why I particularly like this one: First, I'm kind-of fond of the \"Cyber-Attack\" ad I've constructed. Secondly, I'm very happy I could get a satisfactory color alignment with one of my ray-traced spaceships. Also, notice the neat gate that I've edited from the MIDBARS texture.",
