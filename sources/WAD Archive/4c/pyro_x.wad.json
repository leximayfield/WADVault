	"description": "YES! Another gosh-dang weapon conversion by me! This time, you get mostly fire-themed weapons. This weapon replacement is more advanced than all my other ones. I sort of did a huge blowout on these guns, because this is gonna be my last weapon conversion using DEHACKED, now that Custom Decorate weapons in Zdoom is right around the corner. The weapons are much more powerful, but I didn't make the mistake that I (we, I guess, since I didn't make it alone) made in P0wer Weapons. The monsters' difficulty has been increased, so be on the lookout. Anyway, I hope you get a little enjoyment out of this. Try playing it with your favorite MEGAWAD or something... :P",
