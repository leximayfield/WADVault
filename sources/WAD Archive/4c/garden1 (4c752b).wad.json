	"description": "Welcome to the botanical gardens of Deimos. My concept here was aesthetics. I wanted to create an indoor/outdoor scenario that would challenge experienced players and showcase Doom's graphics. Many of the rooms are difficult until you figure out a trick for dealing with them, but the whole level is far from impossible (unless played on skill level 4 or 5, it gets pretty tough that way). The level's big and tricky.",
