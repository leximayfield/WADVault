	"description": "Let's see now...well, it's a DEATHMATCH level, its got a lot o' that sandy brick crap, some lava and no plasma gun. There's lots of new sounds (offspring deaths (really cool, from \"bad habit\":) and an NIN soundtrack). Ummm...Oh yeah, also to beat the level you shoot John Romero and when you do shoot him he says what that ending demon mumbles out when he notices you, un-reversed: \"TO WIN THE GAME, YOU MUST KILL ME, JOHN ROMERO\" There's also a somewhat new death and a modified status bar. There's also a happy face and sad face replacing the # and $ characters.",
