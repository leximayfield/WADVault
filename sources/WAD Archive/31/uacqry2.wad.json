	"description": "Long maps are looooong! And in this case, this one qualify into /idgames because of the compatibility and yet the utter fun it yields to the player. Comes with two vanilla-compatible demos recorded in PRBoom+. (version 1.90) Many monsters, all weapons (all rewarded), from easy to very difficult! Playing in Ultra-Violence the difficulty compensates the weapons! Many monsters = moar carnage! - Recommended to play with Brutal Doom mod.",
