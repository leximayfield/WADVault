	"description": "That's a woman zombie who replaces former human. Haven't you ever thought about adding a female character to Doom? Yes, I know - it could ruin all shoot-n-forget gameplay, because it's much easier to exterminate thousands of agamic monsters. So I decided not to make a sexy, busty vampiress (however there are mods who gives you chance to mess with them) but a lady, who would kick your ass in a minute. She's more Gretel Grosse from Wolfenstein than for example Lara. I hope you like it.",
