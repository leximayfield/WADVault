	"description": "A single room map, with all of the weapons, and tons of ammo, and a whole horde of monsters. A pretty big challenge for a player to finish (the beginning is pretty rough) in a single-player game, but I can do it, so you should be able to as well! =O). I've never tried it with > 2 players... It's kind slow with multiple players until you kill off most of the monsters, and then the speed improves (this is on 486-66 Mhz machines with 128Kb cache) The theme: The world's longest marble staircase!",
