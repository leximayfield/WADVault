	"description": "This outside arena is so complicated that I had to block some areas from visplane areas that happened in corners of the level. I mean \"complicated\" as in there are a lot of 2 sided linedef around. DEU's node builder could barely handle it. This level includes a giant pond with a \"storm drain\" room adjacent to it. It also has a drop hole with an invisibility sphere in of it, so you can drop down in surprise and shoot something.",
