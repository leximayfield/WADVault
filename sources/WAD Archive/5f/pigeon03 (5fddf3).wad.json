	"description": "This is the third installment of Pigeon speedmapping sessions. Main goal was to make a map under a limit of three hours and the themes were: 1) Maps shouldn't go below 1024x1024 and not beyond 3072x3072. 2)Include purple or teal textures. 3)Good usage of crushers. Bonus theme: 4)Draw a signature area outside of the map to identify the mapper. Only one theme is needed to be used. In the duration of both sessions, we had 12 maps submitted.",
