	"description": "These levels are the first I ever made. I had no one to help me learning things about the editor. It needed many hours to experience how to make functionable doors. Sometimes I tried some other functions like crushing ceilings if you want to press a switch and walklines opening rooms where IMP's are only waiting to kill you. I hope you enjoy the levels!",
