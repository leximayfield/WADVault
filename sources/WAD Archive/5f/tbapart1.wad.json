This wad can be beaten without cheats. -SAFETY SPOILER END- The idea for this came from a thought wondering what happens to the player after he triggers a terry trap? This wad was also inspired by dark souls' level design (yes, I should be punched on the face for comparing such a good game with this silly wad) and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure franchise, you'll see some references when you'll play the game.",
