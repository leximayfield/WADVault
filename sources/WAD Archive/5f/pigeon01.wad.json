	"description": "The goal of this speedmapping session was to create maps within a 3 hour time limit. Several mappers, including myself, failed to abide by this limit. Nevertheless, we still raked in 17 maps following the following themes: 1) Incorporate a graveyard and/or underground crypt of some kind. 2) Make good use of lite-amp goggles. 3) Only zombies, skeletons, spiders, and ghosts (zombies, spectres, lost souls, revenants, arachnotrons, and spidermasterminds). Bonus Theme) Lots of green ectoplasm (nukage). Only one theme needed to be used. Maps were created on 10/7/17, during two separate sessions throughout the day.",
