Like Plutonia II, I saw no progression into the project so instead of letting the map go to waste, I decided to release it as a standalone map. I was told that there may be issues on source ports other than Zdoom (no surprise there) when trying to open the blue key door. I only tested this on Zdoom (unfortuently) so I really can't guarantee that this wad will be stable. Cooperative play is highly recommended.",
