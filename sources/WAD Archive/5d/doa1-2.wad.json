	"description": "This is the last of a four-level series. Here you encounter The Conspiracy. Something is not right at the UAC (stay tuned for the full story). This is a fairly large map with a lot of detail, including several special effects (dontcha love that?). Like the first three maps in this series, the emphasis is on a realistic look and feel. The game play is designed for the average player but it's still tough no matter how you cut it. I have included a demo of me finishing part 1 in UV according to the rules of the challenge. Of course, you will need DOA1-1.WAD to play the demo. Check the file DOA1-Y.TXT for more information.",
