	"description": "\"No Way Out\" is a MAP01 Doom 2 wad replacement. This is my first Doom map ever, just wanted to try things out - Would like some feedback if possible :) It is a pretty difficult map, I scale it to be challenging and just not a gun, shoot, win arena. If you wanna change anything or take a look at it, feel free to do so!",
