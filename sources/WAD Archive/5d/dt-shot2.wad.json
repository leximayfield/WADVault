	"description": "Did anyone see the movie 'FireStorm'? If you did, and you are like me, you would have noticed a rather excellent shotgun that saw some action all the way through the film. I liked the shotgun, so I felt like putting one in DooM. Lucky for me, the 'Firestorm' shotgun was the exact same model as the one Duke Nukem uses.",
