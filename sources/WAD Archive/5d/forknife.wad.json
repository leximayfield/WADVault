	"description": "Fork And Knife In the Road is a single level for Doom 2. It's my first released level, and I really hope you enjoy it. I've only tested it in GZDoom, but I haven't used any fancy stuff so it should work fine in other engines. There MAY be vizplane overflows in vanilla, so let me know if that's an issue.",
