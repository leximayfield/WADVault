	"description": "One of my first levels (more specifically, it's my third). It has been continuously modified until I have reached a point where I was satisfied with my level. If you don't download this level, you'll be missing out on hundreds of hours of hard work... Good for DeathMatch. And good for 4 players since many things in this level are in fours. This level has a lot of rooms with something special about each corner of the room.",
