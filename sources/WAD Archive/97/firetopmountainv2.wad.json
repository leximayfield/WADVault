	"description": "The idea for the map is based off of those old Fighting Fantasy books where you used dice and a pencil. It gets its name from the first book, The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. Back in the mid to late 90s I sketched out the map as described in the book and decided to make a Doom level based on it. The floor plan I sketched is long lost, so apart from the beginning of inside the mountain, the rest has been newly created from scratch.",
