	"description": "This single-player-level for DOOM2 tells an enigmatic story. You witness the war between an evil army of SS-soldiers and the demons they created in their blasphemous laboratory while a huge shimmering ivory tower, the symbol of release, rises up on the horizon. There, in the tower's top, you will face your last trial... >>> In addition, this zip-file contains IVORY-DM.WAD, the same level modified for deathmatch play.",
