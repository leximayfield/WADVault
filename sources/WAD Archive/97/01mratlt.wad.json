	"description": "Good mix of open spaces, hallways, teleporters and lifts. Lots of invisible walls, and traps. There are lights in the corners of the court yard, that tell you in what general part of the building to look for your enemy! Single-barrel shotgun close to all starting points; access to better weapons are at a higher-risk, depending on where your enemy is..... Watch your back!",
