	"description": "This is my newest and best Quicken Wad ever. It contains all of my previous levels (with changes) and 4 new ones. Contains new textures, pictures, level names, status bar, sounds, and AWESOME DM LEVELS. The staus bar is a very cool one that I made using a well known one and doom graphics. All of the sounds are serious in nature and really add to the feel of the game. (Check out how great the single shotgun sounds now, you'd think its better than the double) If you only like playing dm then Quicken5 may be too intense for you, BUT IF YOU CRAVE PLAYING DEATHMATCH THEN QUICKEN 5 IS A MUST PLAY WAD!!!!",
