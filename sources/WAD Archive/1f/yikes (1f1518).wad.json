	"description": "This DOOM2, level 1 PWAD encompasses a very large virtual space with a surprise around every corner! I designed it to be a \"mini\" game that takes you from pistol to BFG 9000. it contains a creative use of two sided line defs that I have not seen in any other pwads, and an interesting maze problem. \"Yikes\" should give you a good hour or so of play.",
