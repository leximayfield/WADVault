	"description": "Good one ace. You really screwed up this time. So there you were, back on Mars, stacking toxic waste barrels in an old UAC storrage shed. It seemed like an easy job at the time. Suddenly, without warning, one of the neatly stacked piles that you said \"Would never fall over\", came raining down on you when you ran into it. After that one came tumbling down, all the rest decided that they might as well make your life miserable and come down too. Now there's toxin all over the place. The stuff has had a strange effect on the other workers. They've gone mad and are trying to kill you. It's a race to find radiation suits before you fry your little heinie off. Think you can make it? This is my first big level, so send any comments to ME (constructive comments, not death threats :) Keep yer eyes open, 'cause the BFG is hidden somewhere in this level. I hope this level will keep you occupied, at least until I finish my next level, Journey to Hell and Back!!! It'll be based on the entire perimeter of my house!!! (And it's a hundred acre farm too)",
