	"description": "I was trying to make a level that would be really fun to play, but also very good-looking. I'm very proud of this level and believe I have succeeded for the most part. The \"Hurt Me Plenty\" setting is fairly challenging and UV is unforgiving, but it is possible to get 100% kills (without cheating :) ). Not as hard as some of the other wads floating around, though. I would recommend it to players who like a fairly \"intense\" DOOM experience with a minimum of \"puzzle solving\". There are secrets, but not hard ones. I would appreciate any comments, so I can keep making better and better levels. I can give hints to anyone who wants them, just e-mail. ENJOY!",
