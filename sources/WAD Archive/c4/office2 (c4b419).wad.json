	"description": "Layout of the office building I work in, 2nd floor and outside. Excellent for strategic or all-out-fraggin' deathmatch play. Lots of power-ups/ammo to survive that lucky rocket hit. One secret room (can you find it?). Let me know if you can beat UltraViolence single-player (100% monsters)!",
