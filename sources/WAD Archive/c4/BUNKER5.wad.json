	"description": "Bunker5.wad was designed specifically for DeathMatch play. I tried to take all of the best features from the many different levels that I have played and put them into one level. Many of my ideas came from the people I have played against (there are many of you - you know who you are). Bunker5 has been revised several times and I believe I have gotten all bugs and problems out of it. It turned out a little larger than I had expected, but I believe it to be a very interesting and challenging level. There are a lot of secret places, false walls, and a cool bunker that is impenetrable...... Well Almost! See if you can figure out how to get to the BFG9000, invincibility, inviso, etc.",
