	"description": "The Allied suspect that the Nazis are developing a nightmarish army of creatures that once were humans but have now been biologically twisted into inhuman abominities. There have been rumors of mindless cyborg soldiers equipped with flame-throwers and worse things... You, Captain Blackheart, were sent to explore the hidden laboratory of the mad Doctor Mangler, but his inhuman servitors took you by surprise. You have been captured and taken to the infamous Castle H\u201dllenstein where torture awaits you - - - maybe you will even become one of Mangler's inhuman troopers yourself. Unless you escape. You defeated the nazi trooper that had come to bring you some water with your bare fists, and you have got his handgun, but now are locked up in the prison cell again... and there is no way out except the locked door... no secret doors or anything. What next? If you fail to escape and continue your mission, Dr. Mangler's fiendish troops will surely kick some Allied ass for good!",
