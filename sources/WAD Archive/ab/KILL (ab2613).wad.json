	"description": "Speed might be a proble. Should be OK on 486/33 SX or DX with 8 MB RAM, and a zippy video card. For single play only because I still beleive most people play with themselves???? and there isn't really 2 fair starting points, altho' you may disagree. Quite a large level with lots to kill and a few puzzles to solve. I played it a couple of times so I know it can be done. I'm not going to tell you to be careful and save the game often etc etc, cos you'll play it your own way anyhow.",
