	"description": "Well, the idea came just before I finished WOW! That PWAD is jolly good but there are no modified sprites nor flats. That is because I had only dmgraph to work with, and this program cannot manage these sprites properly. So I downloaded Wintex. Then things have become different! This PWAD is a complement of the first one. I have modified all flats and ceilings and almost all static sprites (torches, columns, etc). In fact I didn't change the enemies because I still don't know what to do with the sounds, but I've got enough material for the graphic part.",
