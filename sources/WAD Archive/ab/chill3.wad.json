	"description": "After a year of on-and-off surgery, the second sequel to Chill has finally hit shelves, all bandaged up and ready to roll. Across nine unique, sleek maps that include two guest maps from mapping heavyweights Ralphis and RottKing, Chill 3 pulls you, your brain, and your gun into explosive action. Within seconds you're flying, dodging, sprinting, hoarding the shit out of items, teleporting, thinking up the next move to bust, pumping rockets and balls of energy through hallways, hiding and laying low, taking stabs at where the fuck your enemy's creeping at, and trying your luck at long-distance shots with the boomstick, all while treating your eyes to some crisp architecture and the ears to the flow of the backing funk: the flow you gotta feel when winding through the levels (if you wanna win, of course).",
