	"description": "The name \"Clack\" has nothing to do with the level, it's just the first thing that came to my mind. Basically, it is a D-Match level based around the idea of keeping the level small, and round, so that you can always run away. It is a risk getting the sphere for you are vunerable from all angles, and if you are blind sided, you'll be swimming in stingy green stuff. Only weapons are fist, pistol, shotgun, and chaingun...(unless of course you stumble across the secret.... hehehe)",
