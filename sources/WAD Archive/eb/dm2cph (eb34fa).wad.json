	"description": "A ten level episode where the theme is set in a castle environment that was designed to have a good mix of battles and puzzles. New Monsters: A Seargent that looks similar to the player for multi-player confusion, Death's Shadow replacing the imps. Remember, this episode is built so that you will never become trapped. Every room that has an entrance, has an exit!",
