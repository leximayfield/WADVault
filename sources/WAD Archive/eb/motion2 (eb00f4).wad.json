	"description": "A sequel and tribute to an ancient wad called 'Motion'. I tried to keep the same theme and style, and feel i succeeded. This is NOT meant as a jokewad, I only tried to create as accurate a sequel as I could. Of course this means the map is ugly, but you might find enjoyment in it as well, particularly if you played the original map.",
