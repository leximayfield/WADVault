	"description": "Episode 3 level 1 has always been kinda : lame for me. Not much happening there....and : the only way to crank it up a little was to : hurry thru it. TOWER.WAD replaces E3L1 with : what I attemped to be a \"classic\" type of : DOOM level. Check out the \"BARON TUBE\". : I should add that this wad was originally designed : for CO-OP play, but has been edited for single : player mode. (It's much more fun in co-op though). : If someone should try it...and you think it's too : busy...please let me know. : : TOWER2.WAD has the HOM corrected in the center : courtyard...plus minor cosmetic changes. :",
