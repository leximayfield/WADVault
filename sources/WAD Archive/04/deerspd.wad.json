	"description": "This map was originally built for Doomworlds speedmapping contest, base theme. A WadAuthor error 70 minutes into the contest deleted the map. Since I was pretty happy with how the map had progressed to that point, I rebuilt the map from memory, plus added a lot more. However, I never submitted the map to Doomworld for the contest since I was way to late. The map, I believe, still rates as being considered small. Depending on your style of play and skill, it should take you about 10 to 20 minutes to finish.",
