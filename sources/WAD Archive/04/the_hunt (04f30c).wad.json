	"description": "This is one Action-packed level. There are load's and load's of secret's to discover, some EZR then other's. This level is PERFECTION in action for single, cooperative and deathmatch play. You start of with only a few creatures roaming around. If you've killed all those creatures you can open up one of the plateau's or containers. There is way more ammo then you will ever need, but most of it is hidden away in secret's. If you know more secret's than your opponent, he is very dead.",
