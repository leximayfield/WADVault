	"description": "Final Transmission of Agent Brendan Raphael Blaskowiecz: When I arrived on Planet Deum last night I teleported into the offices of the ware- house. Disguised as a Cacodemon I was easily able to maneuver through the mazelike corridors until I found the teleporter that took me to the computer facility. In the computer facility I discovered crushing ceilings and after much carnage was able to locate the teleporter to the penal facility. This led to the surface where, after sneaking by a spider demon I arrived at the door to the exit. I am opening the door right ARGHHH....... END OF TRANSMISSION. You will now be deposited into the warehouse where agent Blaskowiecz was sent. You must retrace his steps and discover his fate.",
