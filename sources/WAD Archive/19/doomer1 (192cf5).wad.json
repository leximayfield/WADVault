	"description": "This was one of my oldest if the oldest maps I have released publicly. It is a bit tight in space but a fair amount of action in a Tech/urban textured level. What is different with the tidied up release is fixing a few texture issues, 2 closed sectors and adding additional ammo and monsters to further balance out the map.",
