	"description": "Fourth part of the Eulogy series. This one is probably the best yet. Has a few nifty gimmicks like 'complete darkness' as well as major shadow- casting in one area(the slime pit). Also impliments a Dehacked patch which introduces a new monster, the Nightmare Imp. The Nightmare Imp really is a nightmare. They're quick, always seem to know where you are, have high health(sometimes even the super- shotgun isn't enough)and are partially invisible.",
