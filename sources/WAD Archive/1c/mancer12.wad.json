	"description": "Some of you people that MAY have played ALL of mys WADs would reconize this level as Smoke7.wad. I have taken the level and made major changes! Light levels are the biggest change, I also made it look a lot better too, all though I did keep the origenl textures, don't hurt your eyes :) This level works a bit better with 3 or 4 players. All though it does play very good with 2 players.",
