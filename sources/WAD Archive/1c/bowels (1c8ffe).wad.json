	"description": "You seem to draw the most dangerous missions. Fellow Marines appear to be disappearing at an alarming rate. Most have been tracked to a suspected underground complex inhabited by the undead. Eliminating this fortress of evil won't be easy, and it is for this reason that you have been selected. You enter the complex and stumble upon the first echelon of nasties. \"Is this the best you can do?\" you say to yourself. Keep focused, the action becomes more frantic as you move deeper into their lair. Other hazards exist as well.",
