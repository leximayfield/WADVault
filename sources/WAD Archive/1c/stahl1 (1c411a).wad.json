	"description": "Medium sized deathmatch WAD. Excellent gameplay due to *extensive* playtesting. If the rocket launcher is your weapon of choice, you'll drool over this one. Wide multi-story areas, fast access to (almost...) evey position, sniper windows everywhere - but you can never be sure, your opponent won't slide behind your back while you try to catch a breath. This is a *fast* level which means: 1) You will not find a BFG in here. 2) You will not find poison pools. 3) You will not find jails. If you are disappointed by that, E-MAIL us. We will send you in return a personalized copy of our infamous WAD \"classics of suck\". Enough said. Now go out and do a clean job.",
