	"description": "Well, you're again lost in the infernal maze, and alone against the cibernetic mino- taur; that beast who can destroy you with the two arms tied back...

This is a variant with some corrections in textures and light levels; due to, of course, my neglect building the ori- ginal map for Doom1.",
