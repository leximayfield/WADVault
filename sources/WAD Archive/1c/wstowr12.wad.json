	"description": "This level(WSTOWER.WAD) was very well designed, but had an outstanding number of problems. To start with, texture alignment was a major problem. I didn't see one aligned texture. I have aligned most of them. Also, there were many unnecessary sectors, which made the file very large(500K) and slow. I have deleted all such sectors, and, in the process, reduced the file size to 416K. A total of more then 100 sectors were deleted. Speed has also been increased, because of fewer sectors, fewer nodes, and a better reject map. I have made the level much more difficult. There are now a total of 806 monsters, so if you try to save, it will crash. On UV, if you kill all monsters, it takes about 50 minutes.",
