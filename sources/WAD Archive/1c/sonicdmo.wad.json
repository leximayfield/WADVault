	"description": "This is a playable demo of it, with the first 2 zones (4 maps). I decided to release a demo because a lot of the features are experimental in nature, so I decided that getting feedback would be important, as it could help improve the megamod, and iron out any potential problems, particularly in the gameplay.",
