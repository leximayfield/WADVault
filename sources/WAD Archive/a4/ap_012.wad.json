	"description": "Part twelve in the World's End series. This level is the kind of tech-base map I like, the atmosphere of Doom, the abstract design of Doom2 combined with today's standard of gameplay. ap_012.wad was designed to be fun, but not easy. Gameplay is balanced and difficulty settings + cooperative play are fully supported.",
