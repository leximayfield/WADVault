	"description": "Something of a mini-episode, this .WAD is a collection of nine original Doom 2 levels designed for single-player and co-op play. (Sorry I didn't give this collection a cool name) Styles vary among base/subterranean/semi-hell themes, and I strived to keep a steady and consistent up-down, up-down pacing to the action and difficulty, including traps, secrets, and monster/item placement among (more or less) non-linear level layouts. Levels were authored sporadically over the course of 2011, to the end of December 2013, and touched up a little bit more before this release.",
