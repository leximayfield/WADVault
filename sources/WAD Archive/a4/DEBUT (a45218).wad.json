	"description": "As the name suggests, this level was the authors first serious attempt at creating a DOOM level from scratch. This level took a *long* time to make - not because of any great complexity, but because of the limited amount of time the authors could find together to work on it! (In fact a number of other WADS have been created during the design of this one!) Most of the usual stuff is included, tricks and traps and the like... and even a bit of texture and sound redefinition... Enjoy :-)",
