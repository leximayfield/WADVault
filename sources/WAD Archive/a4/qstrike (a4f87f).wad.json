	"description": "\"Quantum Strike\" is a set of 3 hard, colourful Boom-format maps designed to be played from a Pistol Start. Gameplay is purely action-based with simple progression and generally high monster density. UV is meant to challenge \"good at Doom\" individuals and masochists who don't mind dying repeatedly. HMP should be more fun/reasonable and HNTR more laid back.",
