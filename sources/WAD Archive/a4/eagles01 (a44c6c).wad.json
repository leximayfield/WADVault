	"description": "The first Eagle Speedmapping Session's goal was to make maps within a 2 (in practice 3) hour limit. Six maps were made, and the themes were: - Map must contain a lot of lava and a scene of an erupt volcano - Map must contain a switch which opens the only gate leading to a jungle - Map must be laid out in two floors - the surface and a tunnel leading to the Earth core",
