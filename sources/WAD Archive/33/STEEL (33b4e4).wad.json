	"description": "This one is another a precision level: a couple of wrong moves can destroy your chances of finishing. You might want to get used to using the single barrel in a couple of places in this level. But try the big room with the stairs with just the double barrel - a lot of fun that. It's short, but more open than any of my other levels.",
