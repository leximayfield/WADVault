	"description": "Long forgotten barrow-dam now infested with swamp creatures. Still seems to have a glimmer of life, as the torches are still lit and the doors and switches still operate. Who knows what lurks within the old dam complex... My first Hexen level: a large map with swamps, waterfalls, dam complexes, mountainous areas and a half sunken city. Some secret and non-essential areas also exist for exploration.",
