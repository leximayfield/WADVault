	"description": "JP LeBreton does a weekly stream called WAD Wednesday where he plays random files from the idgames archive. The two-year anniversary of the stream happened recently and we decided to do a community map jam to celebrate. The maps are as follows: \"The Promised Land\" by thomasmolby Having been lost at sea, in a rowboat for weeks, you make it to a small island. Crying tears of joy you thank Poseidon for his mercy, perhaps now...food? company?!. But then imps start throwing fireballs down the cliffs and there's like tech stuff and it's a whole thing. \"Library\" by TinKelp It's a library! \"Simpler Times\" by Trotim All evils end up in hell, forced to relive twisted echoes of their defeat for eternity. Gravelly air of another hastily constructed, prejudicial prison burns your throat. Make history repeat itself. \"MEREDITH\" by quasiotter (O: \"Man On The Silver Mountain\" by Arjuna Gonzales A snow level with a recreation of Castle Sooneck in Niederheimbach, Germany. According to an old family tradition, my ancestors built this castle some time in the 9th-11th centuries. It was destroyed in 1271, rebuilt, destroyed again in 1689, and rebuilt again in the 1830s by unrelated Prussian aristocrats, and oh no its been taken over by Nazis and Doom monsters! ARE YOU READY TO ROCK?! m/ >.< m/",
