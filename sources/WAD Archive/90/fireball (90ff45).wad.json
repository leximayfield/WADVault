	"description": "You against 96 Imps, 12 Cacodemons, and 4 CyberDemons. All in one huge T shaped arena! Don't worry all the enemies except the Cacodemons are basically behind bars, so they can't roam around the arena. The only way I can describe the level is, it's almost like dodgeball, but these balls are on fireball and there are about 100-200 (these numbers are just estimates) of them heading in your direction all at once!! :) This is not my best wad, this started as an expirement to see how many projectiles I could have on the screen without the game crashing. And after playing it a little, I found it to be kinda fun. So I decided to do a little work on it to make it decent enough to upload onto the internet. And this is the finished product of that expirement, \"Fireball Frenzy.\"",
