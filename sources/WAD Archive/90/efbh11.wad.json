	"description": "Okay, so your on this expedition, with the prime directive in mind, \"To find and destroy new life and new civilizations, to boldy kill what needed to be killed anyway.\" Unfortunately, the pilot of your ship was hammered and ran BAM into a mountaintop. Luckily, YOU were able to escape, and as you parachuted down to the ground, you see ANOTHER person from your expediton land somewhere else. Although your ship had many high-tech super weapons on it, all YOU have is a damn stupid hand gun. Maybe the aliens on this planet have some primitive weapons on hand somewhere. When you land you trip and fall into a cave below you. Then you notice something. Electric lights. Hmm, maybe these creatures are not so primitive after all. Then you remember stories of the \"Barons of Hell\" that made this planet their home and brainwashed all the cute animals around so they would be some really nasty critters. \"Shxt,\" you say to yourself, \"this is gunna be harder than I though. Hope that other guy is still alive.\"",
