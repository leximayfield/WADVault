I had just released Tapperoo and was looking forward to a break when doomworld posted about one of my favorite youtubers/streamers hosting a mapping contest. Might as well insert the text screen from Circle of Death. But I buckled down and decided to do this thing. Through a haze of 70- hour long days, foreigner and Kenny Loggins mixtapes , and watching Rick Steve's \"Europe\", I finished it. I'm pretty proud of it, I just hope people don't put that in quotations on a 0-star review. This readme was written before the stream, so I don't know if it's a winner or not. And here's a short story for the people like me who actually like a story in the readme: You've tracked down your prey. The government hired you to find and destroy a giant collossus that goes by the name of \"Eon\". You're not sure if he's actually here, but his mark is: a large demonic tablet with his face straight in the ground. You must destroy the areas he's left his power in; a mining site, a chemical plant, and his own temple, in order to get into the database in the center of the hub. Beware, Eon's power comes from his telepathy and magic, punching you with his mind and summoning his worshippers to fight for him. Good Luck. P.S: this was made in a week and a half, so expect problems that naturally arise out of speedmapping (I know over a week's not really speedmapping, but it was for me).",
