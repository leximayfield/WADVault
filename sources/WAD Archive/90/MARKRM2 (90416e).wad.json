	"description": "This is another in the arena-like series of my wads. (There are now 3 and more on the way.) This one is much more chaotic than any of the others. The was is again basically a large dark room with weapons scattered around on pedestals. However, this time, the whole room is like climbing twisty stairs- it reminds me of mountain climbing. Also as a bonus.... there is a SECOND ROOM of the same terrain with a plasma gun and the chainsaw. There are few obvious hiding places in this wad, but there is plenty of room for creativity. If you liked the original markroom, you might like this one.",
