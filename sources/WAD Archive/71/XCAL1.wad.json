	"description": "I based this wad on the layout of my house...naturally, my house doesn't actually look like this wad....but it is roughly the same layout as my house. There are a few secrets...one is damn big...if you are able to find that secret you will own deathmatch...there are two hidden warps that you will discover...i spent alot of time on this damn thing so if you don't like it then just keep your comments to yourself...if you do like it, don't hesitate to talk about it :)...other than that, I guess I'll just let you play the wad and see for yourself. This is my FIRST wad, so don't blame me if you think it sucks...i don't think that will happen though. I will gladly accept any ideas or constructive criticism which you think will improve this wad or just for future reference. Enjoy.",
