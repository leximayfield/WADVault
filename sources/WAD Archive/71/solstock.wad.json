	"description": "This is an update/remake of MoUAC v.1.0, renamed because my upcoming SP project has taken that name. This mod is meant for use in custom maps and map-pack wads, to \"spice things up\" a lot. The story elements have been removed from this release. They just cluttered things up and were damn cheesy anyway.",
