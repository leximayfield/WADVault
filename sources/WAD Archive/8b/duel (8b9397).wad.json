	"description": "There is nothing better than the stale smell of Gasoline, the oil stained chain, the grime that coats the sides with pride. The chainsaw is truly, a REAL man's best friend. I have been disappointed by the fact that I have never seen a D-Match level based around the art of chainsaw warfare, so I created DUEL.WAD. After passing through a narrow passage over HellWay Dam, you and your opponent meet in a small cage with just a pistol and a chainsaw. There is a Beserk Pack awaiting the quicker man in the center, otherwise wits and speed is all you have to survive.",
