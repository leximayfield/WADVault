	"description": "Doom2 DM map meant specifically for duels. It's very compact & vertical, has some sound cues to track / mislead your opponent, diversity in attacks and ambushes, balanced item placement. Makes for tactical but still very intense combat. Architecture is quite vertical and centers around 2 round pits, all dressed up in q2 textures, and with moody late summer night lighting. Item placement is designed around old deathmatch with a SG, SSG, CS, CG, RL, PG, BFG, with the last 2 putting you at a slight tactical disadvantage when you get them. altdeath adds only a green armour and some health/ammo.",
