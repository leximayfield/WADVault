	"description": "This wad uses many \"tricks\" not specific to any port to create a tremendous 3d atmosphere including but not restricted to over/under bridge effect, room over room, and more. It is compatible and will only work with Zdoom and Legacy as far as I can tell. It will NOT work with GL ports or Vanilaa Doom2. The textures use were mostly taken from a texture wad released by Nick Baker originally slated for Episode 5 of the Nightmare Project but which apparently never got off the ground. The original file has been altered dramatically with a bunch of new custom textures created by myself and Shitbag.",
