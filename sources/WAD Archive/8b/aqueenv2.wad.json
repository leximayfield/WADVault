	"description": "My very first attempt at a Boom-compatible map pack, though it's recommended you instead play in Zdoom and its derivatives for the sake of an enhanced CD-quality soundtrack. The featured maps range anywhere from a tech-greenhouse to a satellite crashed into a cave, and the start/end of each map follows on from the last to emulate a cohesive journey. It also features a new monster, a boss, and was designed with gameplay mod compatibility in mind.",
