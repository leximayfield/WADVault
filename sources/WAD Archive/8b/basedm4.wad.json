	"description": "Base style deathmatch level. Small/medium size. This WAD won't work properly without BooM or some other port that supports all BooM effects that I used. All that the level really tries to be is a base-style deathmatch area. All skill levels have been included. They follow TeamTNT's good deathmatch rules. Drop through the floor in upper floor to fall to lower floor!",
