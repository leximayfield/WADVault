	"description": "A 4 player Deathmatch for Doom II, works fairly well for 2 players also. Basically this WAD is a square with four corridors connecting it to a larger square corridor. There are four rooms containing the weapons. All weapons are present in this WAD. The BFG is semi-hidden, though once you find it it is no problem to get. The main square is a pool of life stealing blood, with a column in the center that has a megasphere on it. The sphere will be hard to get unscathed in a 4 player match, as the apron around the blood pool is dark, and can easily be covered from a distance or upclose. The line defs that trigger the column to come down are too close to allow a turbo-ing player to whiz by without a shot being fired at him.",
