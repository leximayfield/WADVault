	"description": "THIS WAD IS FOR DooM This wad has been created only for CoOp-playing with at least 3 players, but feel free to try it otherwise. This PWAD was designed with the original DooMstory in mind: As calm is around you, you decide to get away. But what's this...your troopships engine won't do so. After two hours of sudorific troubleshooting it is clear: the only way to get out is get trough. And you remember: You heard some of your bodies talking of a big gate they've seen in there. Some scientists thought this to be a dimensional gate. Your decision is clear: you have to get to and through it and show the bad guys that none has the ability to fear you. As you fight your way you notice heavy combat-noise out of the two rooms in front of you... After a short time of intently waiting two fellows of you appear... ' Now, your chances will surely be better '; you thought and one of the guys pressed the button beneath you... ...What the hell...no, not this.............. ....oh NOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!.............",
