My goal in creating this wad was to develop and sharpen my senses as a level designer and Doom wad author. I aimed for an atmosphere akin to DOOM and DOOM II portrayed in an updated visual style; I was really trying to face my poor skills in wad compiling and texturing/detailing. I think I improved somewhat by the end of E1 + E2. All of the music was provided for this wad by Dial-up for Murder. cc4-tex.wad was used as a resource pack. I used GZDoom Builder (Bugfix) r3018, Doom Builder 2, SLADE 3.1.2, and paint.net 4.0.21 to create all of the maps, compile the wad, and create a large portion of the graphics. The status bar was created by galileo31dos01 using SlumpED v0.7 (for testing), Paint, Paint.net v4.0.21. Additional Credits are listed below. :)",
