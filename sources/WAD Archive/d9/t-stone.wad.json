	"description": "Stone Turmoil was just a 90 minute speedmap to begin with, but after getting feedback from the regulars of #dmclub, I decided I'd do a little work on it and release it. Minor gameplay changes have been made since, and skill settings have been added. I've included the original map (note: it has no skill settings, so it might seem hard to some of you), just so you can see the changes I made (if you're curious, that is).",
