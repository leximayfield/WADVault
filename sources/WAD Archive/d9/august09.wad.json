	"description": "Another DEATHMATCH lv in the August-series...Just can't stop! *This one's a bit spicy; it contains monsters!* The lv is not crammed with 'em, i've just placed a few to make the game more interesting... so please play August09.wad with monsters ON and with the *respawn* option ON. The lv itself is quite small so even with 2 players, the action may get too hot sometimes...love it! August09.wad has support for both DEATHMATCH 1 and DEATHMATCH 2 and it's got ALL weapons available (the BFG is not reachable at skill 1/2/3 though).",
