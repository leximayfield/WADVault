This file ignores (End Episode), and well reroute to the next episode when the current is finished. Perfect for multiplayer proposes! Thanks to Kyle \"Skunkrocker\" Guthrie for the episode 4 intermission screen, that SVDoom utilizes and retrieved permission for. Version 1.00: 25 April. 2008 Original Release Version 1.01: 20 November. 2008 Fixed a possible HOM issue that sometimes occur in SkullTag. Version 2.00: 30 November. 2012 * Expunged CISVD.txt; superfluous ASCII file... * Added a new lump 'ZMAPINFO' for engines that support it * Applied level number capability; useful for ACS scripts. * Enforced 'No Jumping' and 'No Crouching'; changable * Enforce 'Smooth Lighting' variable to true. * Enforce 'Normal Infighting' * Ports that use MAPINFO should render intermission screens almost adjacent to those that use ZMAPINFO.",
