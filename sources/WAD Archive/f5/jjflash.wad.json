	"description": "My first try for a DM level (and the first published try at all!). It is small but has some obstacles (\"Jumpin'\") and many many teleports (\"Flash\") that teleport in a different way if you enter them in a different way. I designed the level with extensive jumping in mind, so you should play it with a source port capable of jumping high enough, or you'll find the level useless. If you are into fast fragging and telefragging, you should really give it a try. Tactics are important, too.",
