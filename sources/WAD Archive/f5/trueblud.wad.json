I've also included BLOODZAN for Zandronum for only 2 monsters in there and I gave the lost soul 20 health thanks to a thread on Doomworld I was at. Well, they had too much that's what I've read. Thread was things id got wrong if you're wondering. Not only that, the lost souls have the +NOBLOOD flag since well, they're souls. How could they have blood? Same for the Pain Elemental. !!!ZANDRONUM USERS!!!: Make sure you have the Skulltag_Actors and Skulltag_Data for BLOODZAN and the right version of Zandronum too. That may go the same with the skulltag stuff.",
