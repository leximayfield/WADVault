	"description": "Similar to Congestion 384/64, and Claustrophobia 1024/2, Confinement512 offers 7 new maps fit into a 512x512 area. Except, this time, NOTHING the player sees can be outside the area. Play WITHOUT jump, nor crouching. -- This is also my debut release on Doomworld and my second singleplayer release! Enjoy~ --BloodyAcid",
