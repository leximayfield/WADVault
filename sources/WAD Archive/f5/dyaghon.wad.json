	"description": "Once again it came over me: Another idea for a great hall was born in my mind. So, with the help of DEU, I created a totally new Deathmatch-Pwad. I played it only in two-player-mode and it wasn't that good (to big!), but in a four-player-mode it's fun, I think! (Even if you are only playing two-player, you should get this Pwad, because it's so good-looking!) Oh, the Pwad is called dyaghon, because it's map has a very strong diagonal character... (see dya8.pcx) The ZIP also includes some screenshots.",
