	"description": "It appears that there has been an incident on Nexus 14. Nexus 14 is a mining planet, which basically means its a rock floating in some shitty solar system. Nexus 14 is known across the universe for its rich content of Nuke, a green substance that makes a great meat spread, paint thinner or extra firm hair gel. Anyways, the last report from the Nexus 14 communications centre warned of an attack from creatures released through a time-continuem breach (sorry if that's spelled wrong). You have been ordered to go in as survelance only. You are to assess the situation and be out in two hours to report to your commanding officer so that preparations can be made for a counter assault. The only problem is, you think your tough enough to take on the army of creatures yourself. You stupid twit! What makes you think that one person could possibly drive off an entire army of blood sucking demons from Dimension-X? Fine then, go ahead...",
