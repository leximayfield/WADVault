	"description": "Even those zombie Sarge's need a break from the rigors of mindless plunder. Where do they go when they get a 3 day pass? They go to the rec-center... paid for by their union dues.....good union, eh? Somehow you have happened upon their secret Hole-in-the-Wall. You find that sargents and some of their foreign brethren are like most mindless Hell Beasts.....they like to eat....your buddies! They also take target practice, they read about ancient methods of torture and some even tease the \"pet\" Cyberdemon. Being the Sargent hater that you are...remember what they did to Little John....and on his first recon, you take it upon yourself....THIS HOUSE MUST COME DOWN!",
