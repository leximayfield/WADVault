	"description": "This is about our 5th attempt at a wad file, we have learnt from our mistakes and this level includes some of our better ideas from the early attempts. The level is a fairly dark level based around a large cavern. In deathmatch there are several sniping points and every weapon is available. For co-operative play we have added a couple of extra baddies to make things more interesting.",
