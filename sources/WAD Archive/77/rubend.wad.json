I aslo pay attention to dificulty level; I like fight against lots of those nasty demons, but these combats shouldn't be too hard, a frustrating experience. A good player don't will have too many problems to beat the monsters...; a begginer, of course, will suffer a lot. \u00a1Ah! This level is especially dedicated to my cousin Ruben -aka Sigal-, who is now living in Mexico... Greetings from Anarko, Mazayas, Sento, Luis Maiguel & Cia -and, of course, from the family!-.",
