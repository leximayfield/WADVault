	"description": "Oh boy, get ready to read lotsa stuff. This level is bigger than the other vdeths. Some people like that, some don't. Anyway, the elevator room in the center is turned on by walking around inside it, but you can also turn it on and off by stepping on the red and green squares on the ground. Green is on, red is off. The teleports are self-explanitory. The insisible fort is..well...invisible. There's a switch to raise it, and the inner walls can lower it. There's also a switch at the opposite end of the room it's in that lowers it. There's a switch in the middle of the big staircase which will raise a whole bunch of pillars and also render the invisible fort useless. Another switch in the greyish room will lower the pillars. There's a Death Pit, don't bother trying to get out of it if you fall in. Just avoid it. The switches in the elevator room lower the windowsills so one can get out. If you have any questions, just E-mail me or something.",
