	"description": "This map came to me almost fully formed in a dream, It was the second map I ever made, and so is substantially better than my first which will stay firmly on my hard drive but not good looking enough for it's intended purpose. I still had fun with it so I decided to release it. Map is completable from a pistol start, (with easy secrets)if you do things in the correct order, otherwise you may find yourself punching a baron to death. There isn't a story other than you are in a grubby room with some hell spawn, now kill them.",
