	"description": "Two teams duke it out until only one is the winner. Destined to hate eachother because of their differences, the only option seems to be to fight. The ATG team and Human team fight it out in whatever arena you choose. The winner can only be determined when the enemy is dead. Are you ready? In short, this is a class-based wad, that pits ATG VS Humans. This is mainly intended for Team LMS in SkullTag. Wouldn't work too well anywhere else... This doesn't come with it's own mapset; but don't worry! There's plenty out there to choose from so you can play this stunning piece of work. Go, play, frag!",
