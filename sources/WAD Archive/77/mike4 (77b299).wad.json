	"description": "This is a modified E1M1 from (Doom 1), the super shotgun is in there for all you Deathmatch lovers. Lots of good hiding places in this one, few elevators, invisible walls. Totally amazing for Deathmatch! This is for DOOM 2, this wad was done a few days ago (Oct. 12/94) which I guess makes it one of the first Doom 2 deathmatch wads.",
