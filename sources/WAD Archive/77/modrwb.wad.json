	"description": "A weapons set by me that started out as experimenting with a few DEHACKED tricks, then evolved into something more. I call it \"Rifles with Bawls\" because there are about 5 rifle like weapons in it(like half the guns), and I replaced the health bonuses with Bawls bottles. I ripped and touched up the sprite myself, but I am too lazy to clean it up any further. :P",
