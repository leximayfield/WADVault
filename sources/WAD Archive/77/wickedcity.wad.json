	"description": "I've had the design for this level sitting in the back of my mind for a while. This isn't my first Doom level although I haven't made doom levels for about 5 years so its my getting back on the horse level. But don't let that worry you. This wad takes you from the carpark of a housing estate ( I think they have them in england) to an abandoned station, sewer, factory and various other areas to rescue your beloved who has been captured by aliens/demons/whatever. Theres some anime elements thrown in and some sprites not suitable for younger players, but its all in the interest of doom/wickedcity fun. (Incase you didn't know Wicked city is an anime that I loosely based this level on. All the graphics in this wad though are my own)",
