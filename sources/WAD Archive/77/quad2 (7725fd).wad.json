The four patches are: QUAD.DEH - the Shotgun Guy now shoots a Quad Shotgun with twice the power of the Super Shotgun. QUADRUSH.DEH - as above, but now he rushes towards you as he attacks. OH----!.DEH - a Shotgun guy with an even more powerful shotgun - one shot and you're dead! SYCOSARG.DEH - as above, but once again he charges as he attacks.",
