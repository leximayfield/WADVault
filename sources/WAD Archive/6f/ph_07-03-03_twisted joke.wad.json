	"description": "I signed up for the Doom Advent Calendar. It died. My map didn't :P Basically I've gone for a silly sort of Christmas theme and went for a few new twists. If you can stand ugly mapping, the innovation of the ski slope should be fun :P You have to play through the staged traps and challenges, putting up with a demon who thinks he's Santa Claus (you won't meet him, but he's the one sending the messages that start \"Ho ho ho!\", in order to collect the keys and leave this snowy hell. No difficulty settings, as it's quite easy anyway (IMO). Now has co-op compatibility.",
