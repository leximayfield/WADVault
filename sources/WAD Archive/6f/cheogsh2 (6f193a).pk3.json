	"description": "After the release of \"Cheogsh\", the ideas of what should be included in it have appeared; and the number of those ideas was so big \u2013 that the thought of making Cheogsh 2 have appeared by itself. But initial concept of the wad, around which this wad was meant to be built, hasn\u2019t justified itself \u2013 this has predetermined long and uneasy destiny of all project. As a result, Cheogsh 2 came out not so epic, as it was meant to be initially. But we hope despite that, this wad did not become less interesting. Thanks all who helped us while we were working on it.",
