You got a can of Mountain Dew from the machine. As you began to put the first quarter in the machine, you heard a strange sound in the distance. You see, this base was huge. If you strayed to far without a map, you might get lost. The sound was like this: \"Awrleeowlreeowlreeerowleee\" THAT wasn't wasn't any HUMAN sound! You went in the next room. There, on the floor was a bloody corspe. And in the next room you could hear all sorts of demonic growling and screaming. There, you saw an imp! Next thing you know you see some demons and mindless former humans wandering into the room in front of you. You picked up a shotgun. And then you threw your voice across the room. Demons started screaming like MAD! You could hear mechanical footsteps across the base! Looks like an infestation, and everybody evacuated, and you didn't even KNOW IT! Soon the clamoring died down, and all the enemies went back to their previous unalarmed state. You realize your objective: Kill every bit of hellspawn in this base. Or die trying!",
