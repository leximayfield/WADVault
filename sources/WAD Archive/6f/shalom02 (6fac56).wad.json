	"description": "UAC Outpost Nine was invaded by alien lifeforms. A reconnaissance squad of ten was sent in to assess the situation and secure the outpost. The squad leader reported that the outpost personnel had been killed, and were perhaps cloned for alien soldiers. The last contact with the squad leader was a request for reinforcements -- losing assets fast! There was no contact with the squad leader for twenty-four hours. Since all divisions had been committed to the ongoing battle for the Earth, we turnd to you. Since you were stationed at HQ, we could only arm you with your sidearm. But hey, you're trained Marine, with combat experience -- besides, you've done nothing but bitch about your desk job. You've made it through the outpost entryway, time now to go to the Underhalls below. Hopefully you acquired a few weapons... you'll need them.",
