	"description": "A sequel to Evil Unleashed. An even better designed map than the first one. Great layout, lots of areas where bad guys are attacking you from. Cool secrets to find. I'd say its a slightly harder map than the first one. You start out in the usual tech areas, but you soon find yourself descending into a hellish environement. Players who loved the first one might like this one even bettter. It will run on everything, even Doom95 can handle this map without problems. All in all a very classic Doom map, good for 10/15 minutes of old school gameplay. I love Doom.",
