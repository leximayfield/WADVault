	"description": "One day, after playing alot of levels that thought that quantity was better than quality, I though why not make huge a level? So I started and from a few months work spawned this monstrosity. Exploration is cool. If you know what to do then you can finish this level in about 10mins otherwise, get compfy. My computer teacher was astonished of its size, although Im sure theres bigger. This level does slow my 486DX2 66 (8mb) when on the harder difficulty settings but supposedly runs a dream on a pentium. So stop reading and get immersed.",
