	"description": "A level pretty much suited for Deathmatch play only. A single winding sector with four player and four deathmatch starts, various pesky little monsters, and various weapons ranging in strength from chainsaw to plasma gun. (Beware launching missiles at a dead run in a twisty canyon or it really will be a dead run <g>).",
