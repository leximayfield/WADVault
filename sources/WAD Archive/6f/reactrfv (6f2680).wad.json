	"description": "Last version (I promise) of the first Doom level I ever made. I made the original version over a year ago. While I was completing The Waterfront, someone emailed me, saying how much they liked Reactor. So for old times sake, I went back and played it. How embarrassing! By my current standards, it sucked! So when The Waterfront was done, I decided to do a complete make- over on Reactor. I wanted the Doom 2 monsters so I converted it. I had to borrow a few of the Doom 1 textures to make it look right, namely the episode 1 sky and the sladdrips. Also, since I was never really happy with the Doom 2 music, and since it was looking sort of reminiscent of the Doom 1 levels, I borrowed one of my favorite Doom 1 themes (e1m3).",
