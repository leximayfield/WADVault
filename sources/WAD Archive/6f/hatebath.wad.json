	"description": "This level is about one thing: challenge. If you can overcome the hundred-plus demons in this level you will feel quite satisfied. There are wave after wave of them, but they are quite manageable if you keep a cool head. Have fun dudes. - A good time for finishing is about 6 minutes. - I didn't pay much attention to skill levels. The map is geared for DOOM veterans.",
