	"description": "A relativly small, straightforward Deathmatch level with few bells and whistles. The basis of the WAD is a large, octagonal area with a deep lava pit in the middle. Five accessable pillars rise from the hellhole. There are numerous obstacles to dodge around, and an additional room with a deadly trap in it.",
