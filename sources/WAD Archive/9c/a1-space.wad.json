	"description": "A1-SPACE.WAD is a huge abandoned space-ship, with four major levels, all connected by a central elevator. Each level contains large areas, filled with various hazards, objects and weapons. The best bit: All the rooms etc. are connected by futuristic looking tunnels [a la ALIENS, but better graphics :)...] This WAD is designed for deathmatch... and SCARY deathmatch at that. For more atmosphere, read the background story.",
