	"description": "About a year ago, there was a small CP on DW that was about putting the Aquatex texture pack, created by jmickle66666666, to good use or something, as the pack was planned to be included into Freedoom. At about the same time I've finished JUPCARN3.WAD and was in search of new mapping thrills when I stumbled upon this thing, and opted for a MAP03 slot. After a month of hard work, I came up with a badass techbase map, but apparently everyone stopped giving a damn about the project, so the map was just kinda rotting there for about a year. Well not anymore ayy lmao",
