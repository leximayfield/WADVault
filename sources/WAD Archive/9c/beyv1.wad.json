	"description": "A large base overrun by two enemy factions at the same time - emergency lockdown has been initiated. This map was originally supposed to be the first (second, actually) level of an entire episode started in mid-2004 in order to shorten the wait for Doom3, but did not advance beyond 1.5 maps (surprise surprise!). After sitting around on my HDD for five years, I decided to put some finishing touches on and release it along with an early WIP version of the fourth map (E1M4 - not playable, only included for archival purposes). Maybe I will get around to continue working on the episode some time, but at the moment it seems unlikely.",
