	"description": "This a huge deathmatch level made by cutting and pasting together parts of e1m1, e1m2, e1m3, e1m4, and e1m5. It's intended for regular deathmatch, and there are no energy weapons. I added a lot more to idmix.wad, and I redid the layout a bit. Idmix.wad was hastily thrown together. Now the the ceiling and floor tiles are properly aligned (at least where it counts) and the exit works :).",
