	"description": "Our first WAD together. Ooog's first WAD all together. Dr. DooM's 5th or so. This is made for a DooMer kind of below average. Not much monsters. Lots of lifts. No real maze though. Just a walk through. One hint: In the yellow key hall, there is a red room and blue room. Pick the red room and suck Cyberdemon rocket and nuking floors. The blue one leads you to 3 demons and a medikit. Which one do YOU think is best? Watch out for the Spiderdemon! (in a secret room) I'd like your input about this level. E-mail us with what you think.",
