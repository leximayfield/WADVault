After a two-hour talk, UAC has agreed to send all their present information to them, if they do the same on Talay. The story is sent through a portal and into the hands of government officials. Here's the jist of it: They have been useing advanced technology for the last 25 years, and didn't want the ideas to be stolen before they could lock 'em. Now the procedure is finished. They can put anything into this \"black hole\" and have it appear anywhere in the galaxy. The only problem is that anything can beam back. Throughout the year, strange things have been coming through, weird bugs, artifacts, even an egg. It seems as though another race is toying with them. The Talains have taken on an evil way, being so caught up in protecting their software, they take humans and do insane expiriments, like testing how long they can survive while being flooded with Carbon Monoxide, and trapping them. But the test subjects, or logs, have been on strike. they've been kiling everyone and everything they find. Some have been put in cells that will explode on contact. ----END OF COPY---- Back at UAC, Talay pleads for more workers for its Base. To keep this truce stable, they ask how many. Eight is their reply. You and a cast of 7 more beam down to Talay.",
