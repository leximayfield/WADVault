	"description": "There was once a mighty king who ruled his province with fairness. Everyone was happy, but one day a evil mage came by the province looking for a magical ruby. The king refused to lend him the ruby but the mage, angry and miscontent, transformed his beloved province into a big swamp. Everyone in his province left, but he and his wife stayed in the province, never to be seen again.",
