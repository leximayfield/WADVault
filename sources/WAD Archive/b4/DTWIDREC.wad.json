For those who don't know what DTWID is, you might want to check out the thread so you can get an idea of what this map's all about, the thread can be found here: http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/52046-doom-the-way-id-did-update-romero-makes-a-welcomed-appearance/ Be sure to play some more of these guy's maps as well, they're pretty sweet!",
