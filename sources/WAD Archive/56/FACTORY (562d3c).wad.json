	"description": "It is said that the old factory on the outskirts of town is still run by zombie employees. They say that the old workers went insane and started to slaughter each other a few years back. Few escaped and barricaded the place in hopes that nothing else would get out, and that nothing would go in. The 3 or 4 survivors said that the toxic waste within the structure caused the men to suddenly become overly paranoid and \"loco\". They began to kill each other, but something kept bringing the dead men back. Nothing ever dies forever in there...\"sounds cool!\" You say to yer friends. \"Let's check it out, unless y'all are scared or something?\" \"Hell no!\" your friends reply, \"Let's do it.\" When you reach the towering building you tear down the door and enter... In making this level I used some techniques that I like to see in D-Match level...TRAPS! I have made two different traps (The Crusher and Incinerator) which are activated by a player. When yer opponent is stuck in one of 'em activate it by triggering the sensor triplines. (They look like two square pillars with lights...) and watch/hear your pitiful friend either become 2 inches thick or slowly cook. >-) Do not be discouraged to get the BFG, even though you're walking into a trap. Because if you can kill the other guy before he/she can activate the incinerator you will be set free...free with a BFG under your arm...time for a couple of easy frags... :)",
