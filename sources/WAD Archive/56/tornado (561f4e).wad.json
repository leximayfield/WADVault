	"description": "Well, I picked the name because a tornado just missed our house the other day. Seemed fitting for a wad file. This is a medium sized level. Pretty tough in the hard setting. No Cyberdemon or Spider- demon. There are a few Barons, though :-). You'll need all 3 keys to exit, one of the keys is in a hidden room.",
