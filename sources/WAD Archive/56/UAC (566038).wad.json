	"description": "I made this just out of boredom. I originally intended it to be the \"official UAC building,\" and went from there. I've been working on it since sometime in 2000 on and off (more of the off). I only recently converted it to Doom II format so I can use the additional monsters. I tried to include a lot of detail in the level and keep it interesting. The typical scheme of the levels is that humans are inside, monsters are outside. I plan to have several outside levels later on.",
