At one point, I got the brainy idea of modifying MAP01 from my wad and turning it into a Death Match version, with revamped architecture and improved flow. The rest of the wad wasn't that great, and I didn't really think any of my other maps would go well with this -- so we have the final incarnation of MAP01, from my old co-op wad, in DM format!",
