	"description": "Legacy of Heroes is a Boom compatible episode for Doom 2 with 11 levels. The maps use the textures from Eternal Doom and the themes for the most are fantasy oriented. The maps also feature a more adventurous style and the level progression was made to make feel the episode like a continuous journey. Some levels are very long and all of them were desgned with pistol starts in mind. The last level has a custom dehacked boss. This is the first wad I started to work on it, the development started in March 2015 and ended in October 2016 though works weren't continuous.",
