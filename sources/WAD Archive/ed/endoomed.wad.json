	"description": "This huge 230+K level features most all of the ememies in Doom II including Cyberdemons and Spider-Masterminds which are not just thrown together in one room but are well placed. The level is based on the E2M8 and E3M8 levels in DOOM I. It has a \"Jail room\" in which the object is to entrap the enemies, where one false move puts you in the middle of a cyberdemon crossfire. The level has significant weapons and ammo so you won't have to use the cheat codes. Other rooms throughout the level follow the \"Hunt the Cyberdeamon or Spider-Mastermind\" theme. Most textures are well aligned and much thought was done in constructing it. Supports and is designed for Deathmatch and Co-Op as well as single player. Hint: I goes before II.",
