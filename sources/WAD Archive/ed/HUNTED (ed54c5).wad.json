	"description": "HUNTED.WAD is for DEATH MATCH!!! Straight forward smash-mouth design in the spirit of FLENZERZ & MOJO.WAD. I always leave out that annoying CLAW so don't look for it!!! THE HUNT has been heavily play-tested and is ready for the pros... All my wads are \"NOT\" recomended for beginners. It takes a keen eye and a steady hand...You gotta know those key strokes 'caus this aint that runninaround shoot anything that moves DOOM thing, it takes a little more brain work and coordination... None of my wads are for people who like to hide so get out there and fight!!! <evil grin> Monsters are for target and maneuver practice only!!!",
