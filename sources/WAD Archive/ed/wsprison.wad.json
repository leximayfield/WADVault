	"description": "Well its taken me two weeks to finish making this wad. If you explore the entire wad and kill every enemy it will probably take you around 35 minutes. I put in plenty of ammo, medi kits, and armour for multiplayers. I also put in a few traps so be careful. I hope you enjoy playing it because I enjoyed making this wad and it will probably be my last one since Doom II will be out shortly.",
