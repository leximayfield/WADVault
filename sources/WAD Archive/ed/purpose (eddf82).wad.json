	"description": "This is an E2M1 level that could just as easily be an E1M1 version but to keep it out of shareware hands I made it an E2. (really guys, you should go ahead and register. You won't be disappointed.) The idea here wasn't to create a huge level but instead this is to be used as a launching point for additional levels/missions. The puzzles are basic and the shootouts (IMHO) are fun rather than always being cut-throat.",
