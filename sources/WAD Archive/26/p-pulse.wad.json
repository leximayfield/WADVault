	"description": "DEATHMATCH ONLY! You can play single or co-op, but why bother? This level is designed for pure adrenaline pumping deathmatch action. Smaller in size, with most of the combat area visible from any point. There are a few secrets in this level, see if you can find them. The exit CAN be accessed by one player, and is clearly labeled. 2.0 rules are recomended.",
