	"description": "Extreme planning went into the play flow on this level. The archeticture is designed around a large castle with guard towers that hold each access key. The level is extremtly non-linear to allow for the player to choose a varied path each time. Ammo and Health is placed in key positions, not enough to be wasteful, but more than enough to finish the level from a pistol start.",
