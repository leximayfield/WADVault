	"description": "You've just transported into the Cybo-Demon's base of operations. Now all you have to do is find him and take him out. Somewhere in the base is his station-control-room, from which he radios messages to other UAC bases and of course the inhabitants of the one you're in. But beware! The Cybo-Demon is tricky! Once you spot him he'll do anything to make sure you stay....dead or alive.",
