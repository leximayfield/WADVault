	"description": "Simply Put, A Deathmatch Level With BYTE. Nothing fancy, Just 6 Different playing fields loaded with ammo, weapons, and bonuses. The health is not as heavy, nor are the monsters. Thats why it's an excellent Deathmatch wad. NO DOORS, Or Lifts. I like the even playing field, with the exception of SNIPER POINTS <G>. Lot's of Warps, so you can hear your apponent, but wont know which warp to take.. Oh Yea!, The Name of the WAD File Reflects the Name Of The Music I incorporated into this WAD.. Pretty Cool!! Another Strong point to this WAD File is the NARROW Hallways, and pass- through's. If your aim isnt exact, it could very well kill you in the end... He He! NO HIDDEN ROOMS IN THIS WAD... Why? It's Deathmatch",
