	"description": "This is the third one in \"The Cage\" series of levels built for deathmatch games. This time, it's a little tricky to get into the cage, but there are lots of goodies if you can make it there. Playing this level in a death- match is especially fun because you can turn off the warehouse lights on people during a cross fire and take them out one by one, that is if you happen to have the goggles! Have fun!",
