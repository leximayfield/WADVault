	"description": "Big inspiration from E4M1 \"Hell Beneath\". This map is symmetrical, linear and has copy/paste details, but I guess it's playable at least. I was suppose to release this map into my Ultimate Doom megawad, but I decided to release this individually. Although I'm probably going to add this to my megawad either way, but that megawad is going to take me for about 10-20 years at least to make it.",
