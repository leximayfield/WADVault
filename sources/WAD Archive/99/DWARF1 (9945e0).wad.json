	"description": "If you are looking for a hard level to finish, well you got the wrong one here, this level is made strictly for playing Deathmatch! Sure there are monsters, but for a veteran, this level will be cake! Although there are a few good secrets with some goodies beyond. Watch for areas w/ one way walls to see through, very good ambush spots. Basically, this level is an arena w/ ledges and rooms built off of it! ENJOY!",
