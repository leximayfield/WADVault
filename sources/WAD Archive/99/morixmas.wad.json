	"description": "At the first time in my Doom mapping carreer, I could make a proper map for the holidays. Consider it as a speedmap because I was very fast at creating it, but it still took two days of heavy work to finish it. Anyways, I hope you enjoy! Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year - not only for 2014!",
