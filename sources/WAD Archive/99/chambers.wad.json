	"description": "This level is set in 5 basic sections. One is open aired, with some platforms. One is a maze with some nice sniping points. The exit room has two sides. If you can figure it out, there is a great trap to kill your opponent in deathmatch. It may take some doing, but the result is well worth it. There is also one large secret room with a wide selection of baddies to mop up, as well as numerous treats.",
