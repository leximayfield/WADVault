	"description": "This is my 'ultimate' collection of my own WADs. These levels were some of the first levels I ever made. They have been totally reconstructed since then, so they also could be used as deathmatch levels. The last level (6) may seem a bit boring at the beginning, but if you play it to the end, you will have some trouble with some (a lot) Icon-throwers!",
