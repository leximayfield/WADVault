	"description": "Having dug yourself out of a UAC prison for conspiring with several hell-aligned cults in the invasion of Earth, you now find yourself in a forest outside the maximum security prison, likely wanted and searched for by global police. Although nothing seems like it did before, likely owing to overdosing on the drugs you were prescribed to in prison. The fate of your life is uncertain at this point, but you have to push on regardless.",
