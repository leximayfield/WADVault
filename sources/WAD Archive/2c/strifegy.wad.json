	"description": "One night, a person who goes by the screename \"MasterOFDeath\", was quite bored. Tired of mapping for the day, because of just having finished MoDDM2 map02, he was toying around with skins and was shocked when he noticed that there was not a single skin made out of StrifeGuy! So he set on some stuipid 30 minuite journey to make one. Sadly it took 45 minuites because of \"annoyances\". Then, it happened, he finished the stupid little skin, and wrote this textfile, and then uploaded it. Fin.",
