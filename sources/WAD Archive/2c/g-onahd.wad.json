	"description": "This wad is a sequel to ALPHA and BETA which were never released. So the story won't make much sense to you, but here it is anyway. It has been four months now since Linguica cryogenically froze himself and now he is awake. His psychic data link informs him that the same demons are back. They've taken over the weapons factory. Attempts to contact agents ButtShark and AssAnus fail. It looks like Linguica is the only man on earth who can stop the demons.",
