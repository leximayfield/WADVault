	"description": "Boxing. You fight someone else with your fists. There are no weapons on this level. The rules are simple: 1) I was too lazy to do something like write a dehacked patch that would disable the pistol, so you're going to have to trust each other to not use the pistol. 2) I put in two exits, so you can get the frags properly tabulated, and for the single player practice mode. Don't use the exit until all are ready to leave.",
