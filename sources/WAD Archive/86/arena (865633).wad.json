	"description": "Made with DEATHMATCH in mind... Got kinda carried away with size, It would have been larger but I seemed to have run out of conventional memory.Thats why the large east room is incomplete, the goodies are there but the workers never finished unpacking the crates. They've done a lot of overtime and they're not in a good mood,so be careful in there. The game has been tested with a multiplayer network, It's likely to be a hard one on your own.... UPGRADE! : VOID THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH! I got ahold of EDMAP and converted the place for doom II. It is now virtually impossible in single play mode. I never did finish that east wing... BONUS!!! I threw in a modified e1m1 from doom 1 upgraded for DOOM II!!",
