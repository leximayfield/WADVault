	"description": "This is a compilation of the WADs entered in NiGHTMARE's third speedmapping exercise. Participants were given 100 minutes to create a Doom 2 level on a certain theme. This week's theme was to design a tribute to (not a remake of) participants' favourite level in either Doom 1 (excluding episode 1 (although someone broke this rule), e2m8 and e3m8) or Doom 2 (excluding map01, map07, map30, map31 and map32).",
