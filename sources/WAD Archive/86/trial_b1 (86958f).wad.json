	"description": "This is basically an unfinished wad. I wanted to have some outside input. I plan on expanding the level and maybe adding more levels. This all depends on time and if I can figure out a good theme for my doom world. If you have any comments / flames please E-Mail me or post to alt.games.doom. This is my first attempt at creating a playable doom level, so any advice would be great :)",
