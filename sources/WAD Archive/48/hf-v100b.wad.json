	"description": "Hell-Forged is a reboot of Demon Eclipse's Episode 2. It no longer directly relates to the story in Doom 1, as the original project did. Instead it takes place on a different medieval human world where Hell has begun its invasion. It is, however, a sequel to DE-EP2, chronologically.",
