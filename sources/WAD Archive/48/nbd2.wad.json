	"description": "This was a sort of experimental concept map. Basically, what I did was find snippets of each level in the doom2 IWAD and make a one-level wad from scratch where you progress through in one cardinal direction, north. I stayed true to Doom II's architechture and design. Because I stayed true to that style, don't expect any crazy cool design or gameplay gimmicks or anything eye-opening (remember that Doom II's levels had texture misalignments too!). The way each area progresses, you'll always be going north. Hence the title.",
