It uses ZDoom's sky box specials, so you : need some of the ZDoom 1.23 beta versions or highter. : The effect has some limitations though. Since the sky- : box seems to be rendered always from the same angle : you can't place the portal teleporters where you want : them. They have to be in a 90\u00b0 angle to each other : Just look at the wad how to place them. I hope you : like this effect. If you do, feel free to drop me a : line :)",
