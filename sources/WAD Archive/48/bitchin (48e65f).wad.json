	"description": "Single or multi-player coop. Lots of nasties and no annoying mazes. Just bob & weave and blast away! Lots more enemies & bonuses in multi-player mode. All are beatable without cheats.If you have to cheat, take up tick-tack-toe or some other less challenging game. Most levels contain hidden transporters & weapons caches so multi players can beam back into action. P.S. Coloured doors stay open so you don't have to go looking for keys again.",
