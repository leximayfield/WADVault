	"description": "This level is designed for a single player, although cooperative play is also good. I've tried to throw a little bit of everything in here. You may have to die quite a few times before you can make it all the way through. ** Hint ** I believe it is sometimes better to run than fight. I've also included a demo of yours truly completing the entire level on skill 4.",
