	"description": "After playing one of my old favorites, CYBRDETH.WAD, I released that there's really a lack of GOOD Cyberdemon battles in Doom maps. Oh sure, there's always the newbie maps with 50 Cybers in one room and 1000 BFGs lying all over, but that's no fun. So I made this map to fill that gap, and also to provide a challenge to veteran Doomers like myself.",
