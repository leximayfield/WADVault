	"description": "This is an assault scenario on the classic Star Fortress.. You have unexpectedly found yourself somewhere on earth in a concrete walled Fox hole, in an extremely large steel-plate lined crater. Just off in the distance, in the center of the crater is an old style Star fort: Which has obviously been occupied, and fortified, by the creatures. Remembering how the American natives once did it on horseback- You grit your teeth, grab some munitions, and take the battle to them at a dead run.",
