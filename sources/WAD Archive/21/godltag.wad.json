	"description": "DeathTag is an awesome concept. You work as a team to score points while still having an intense DeathMatch going. But no one made DeathTag levels for Old DM except for Judas 22, and in that level, all you had to do was make sure you always had the RL and the other team would never score. Hopefully, this level manages to combine the best of Old DM carnage and DeathTag playability. It's been beta tested a few times, but I would have liked more. At any rate, I still expect any of you DeathTag players still out there will find this a pretty intense level. If you're still in doubt, go to the web site above and check out the preview of this level to get a feel for the scoring procedure.",
