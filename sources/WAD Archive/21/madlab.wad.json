	"description": "A moderately-sized techbase heavily inspired by Ultimate Doom episode 2 (especially Deimos Lab). The difficulty is easy/medium, and is a 5-10 minute play. This is designed for single player, but functions well in cooperative too. As this is my first release, the map is a bit underdetailed, and was originally completed in May 2005. I made a few changes to it before uploading, but these were mostly cosmetic (light values, textures) so as to keep the 'first map' feel.",
