	"description": "Doomed Space Wars is a Star Wars-inspired mapset but with mostly Doom enemies and weapons. There are 9 levels divided into 3x 3 level mini episodes and 3 secret levels. At the end of each 3 level mini episode there is a boss. Every map is huge and takes advantages of Zdoom's special features such as 3D floors and reverb. Also there are tons of secrets and a few top secret Easter eggs. The aim for the level design was realism and a dark atmosphere, with huge height variations and a semi linear overlapping progression. I focused hard on lighting and architecture to create a super realistic environment to go with challenging gameplay but there are no slaughtermaps, sorry guys. Also included are 10 exclusive Deathmatch levels. Also in addition are 9 new monsters thanks to Zdoom's DECORATE feature and also I cannot forget the totally original orchestral soundtrack composed by me with the songs in .mp3 format.",
