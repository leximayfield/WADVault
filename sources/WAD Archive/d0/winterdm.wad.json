	"description": "The levels of this deathmatch wad all have a particular winter/christmas (no offense) theme. I was actually inspired by an xmas wad by the ByteBrothers that was released a long time ago. It only had two levels, but it took place in a lovely village with christmas decorations. Even the enemies were changed to presents, reindeer, snowmen, etc. Well I have played that wad once a year ever since then during christmas (i know i'm crazy). I borrowed a few textures from that wad and now I have constructed this deathmatch; I suppose to re-live that earlier xmas wad. Enough about inspiration and all that mushy stuff, let me describe this wad. It is a deathmatch wad, nine levels, winter themed. Each level is supposed to be unique to the wad pack. In other words, I tried my hardest to make all of the levels vastly different from one another. A variety so to speak, but each with some element of winter init, whether it be snow on the ground, snowing, christmas decor, etc. The style that the players will battle it out in the levels also varies, with some levels being more suited for say 4 players, while others are suited for large brawls. Of course I kept a consistency overall...but before I blab on (ha!) let me break it down to a \"brief\" summary of each level:",
