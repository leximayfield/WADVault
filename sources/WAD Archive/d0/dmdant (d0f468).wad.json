	"description": "This is my first level, folks, so be gentle with me. For the most part, the only \"theme\" I had in mind was to make the level as aesthetically pleasing and consistent as possible. In other words, I wanted it to look neat. There are lots of little nooks and crannies scattered about, and (I hope) a few sur- prises. I really hadn't intended the level to be so big (128K) when I first started; but, you know, one thing led to another and I just didn't know when to stop.",
