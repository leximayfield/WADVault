	"description": "An unfinished project of mine from years and years ago, featuring custom weapons, enemies, and early attempts of Xasermapping. Quality is mixed -- some areas are neat but others suck. I just figured I'd show you guys what I did in the years long before Zen. See below for more information. Not much of a storyline, but it takes place during the same timeframe as Doom 2 in an \"alternate world\", if you will -- another human plane taken over by Hellspawn. Strange properties include fire-based weaponry and unorthodox Earthen architecture. Basically just a bunch of weird crap.",
