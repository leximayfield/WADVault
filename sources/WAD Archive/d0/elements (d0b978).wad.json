	"description": "You stagger through the portal which opened in front of you as Korax's foul body crashed to the ground. Immediately, you are engulfed in mystical flames.... When you come to, you are standing in a wooden entryway to a bigger chamber with seven glowing portals... each with their own \"label.\" You see pictures of ice, fire, earth, air, steel, swamp, and water above them. Soon, you will discover your true enemies in Hexen.... your closest friends!!!",
