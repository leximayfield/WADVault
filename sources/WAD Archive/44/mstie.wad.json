	"description": "This wad replaces quite a few of the sounds in the game. I tried to get the levels pretty consistent, but some of my tapes are old. Those tapes didn't come out very loud even with the gain cranked up. I hope you enjoy this wad, I had a fun time making it going through all my tapes for a weekend.",
