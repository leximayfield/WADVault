	"description": "NOTE: Please be aware that this is not 100% complete. Not all of the maps have wehi (weapons, enemies, health, items). I made this map pack for a forum I was on during 2009. The forum host and I were the only ones active and we went our separate ways a few months later when he decided to upgrade his forum and I was roaming around the net. I had to change the title of the wad because I don't want to get in trouble with him, or anyone else. These 8 maps are based off of a train station, train tracks, a tower, and a prison (please don't ask why because it was 7 and a half years ago). E1M1: Ticketing Area E1M2: Waiting Area E1M3: Train Tracks E1M4: Subway* E1M5: Train Tracks (Employee Section)* E1M6: Tower E1M7: Prison E1M8: Abandoned & Invaded Train Station/Tracks *I know that there isn't a lot of wehi in these, just please bare in mind that this was my first single player map pack EVER",
