	"description": "The third instalment in the series of maps...yeah. Once again I just went the way of scripts, although I did add some colored lighting for effect(isn't too distracting)and whatnot. The scripts are just the most fun part of making a ZDoom map though. I can a actually talk to the player while he's playing the map, like I did here. You're lucky I know all that text is annoying otherwise you'd be seeing it every five seconds. I love it! Also you need to use jump in this map, and mlook is good too, for aiming and stuff.",
