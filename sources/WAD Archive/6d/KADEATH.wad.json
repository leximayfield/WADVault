	"description": "A huge, fairly straight foreward level that is is my second attempt at designing a new wad. I do not have any real story behind designing this wad. However, you should be able to complete this wad without the use of any \"special commands\". The reason I started building this is because I have played most of the other wads out there, and I thought I could do a better job. Boy was I wrong. Building a good wad, takes time and patience. Neither of which I possess alot of. Happy Hunting.",
