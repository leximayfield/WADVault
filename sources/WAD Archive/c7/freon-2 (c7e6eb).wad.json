	"description": "You might only like half, or less, of these levels. They vary so much and some are so wierd, you may hate them. A few really cool levels, made especially for deathmatch play (-altdeath recommended) Tried to have a wide variety of playing styles and levels supported. From my SUN level (fast action like level 7) to Castle (well, a modern castle) that supports team deathmatch. All (well, 90%) of deathmatch starts are placed in raised 'protected' areas, and some even have a 12 gauge for you to start with. It makes things alittle more fair.",
