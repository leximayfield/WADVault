	"description": "Initially started as a pure shotgun gameplay map. Only providing the shotgun weapon (although I also added the chaingun now because the enemies are too much) and hordes of monsters that take one shot to get down. Then I also tried my level design ideas (city lights at the beginning, stary sky at the end). And trying to finish this fast and release it, it became a hell of monster cramped map that take a long time to finish with those weapons especially in hard levels. But if you like such maps and pure shotgun action then this is for you.",
