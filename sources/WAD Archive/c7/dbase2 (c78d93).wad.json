Which is odd, because it was definitely the 5th of June about five seconds ago, and you were at your friend's birthday party, not here... Frantically, you cast your mind back to the time which was presumably a week ago. There was that girl; a real shocker. That was your most recent memory - the girl. Cascading chestnut-brown hair and bright blue eyes; shame about the complexion. Actually, hang on, how many people have you seen with grey skin hanging off them...? And was that really her cheap perfume that smelt of rotting flesh...? More memories come back to you, fleeting glimpses of something almost like those movies you weren't allowed to stay up to watch as a kid. Rooms full of zombies... evil experiments in dark laboratories... more and cheaper ways to efficiently zombify lots of people at once. The worst thing was, you seemed to be helping them! Something fishy's up on the Martian colony. You jump up from where you are sitting, and decide there and then to go and do something about it. And there the story starts... This file was originally distributed (via my web site) as DBASE.WAD but later renamed to avoid conflicting with another file in the idgames archive.",
