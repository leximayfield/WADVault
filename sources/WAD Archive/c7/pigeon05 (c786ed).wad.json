	"description": "This is a speedmap project which the mappers did maps with a set of 3 themes (non-obligatory to do all 3 themes) and had a time limit of 3-4 hours for both sessions. The themes were sky/alien maps, 333 thing count and floor/ceiling texture change with a fourth bonus theme which is platforming. The session happened in April 7th, 2018. This wad has been updated because of bugs found in testing.",
