	"description": "This wad was designed to try to be a single player, a coop, and a deathmatch wad (Try playing deathmatch on skill 4 or 5! FUN!). It's my first wad too let out into reality, but I've made wads before this, just never let them out, so I know how to make some cool Doom2 stuff. I tried to make every type of background, so if you like wooden walls, dead bodies all over, computeristic chaos, or dark, creepy rooms, expect it to be in there somewhere.",
