	"description": "The products of Doomworld's 24th speedmapping session, started by Solarn. The session was held over five weekdays from May 24 to May 28. The theme was \"metal\" and only one map doesn't conform to it, but since it was made for the session and has good gameplay, I decided to include it anyway. Some maps have difficulty settings, but others don't.",
