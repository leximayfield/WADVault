	"description": "SECURITY TO THE BIDET! Jean Luc is nowhere to be seen, the security team was toasted hours ago and Deanna Troi has a headache. Just why the Enterprise is crawling with Imps and Cacodemons, no-one knows. They should be aliens with latex on their foreheads and noses, but alas, we make do. You are Ensign Wesley Crusher - your mother was on planet leave when _strange_ things started to happen. Data got a life, Lwaxana became a nun, the security team came back from planetside intact, Worf came out of the closet, Riker _didn't_ scam on some babe and Tasha Yar came back from the dead ... again. Ya-know, it's the little things that give it away. It's gonna be a tough day.",
