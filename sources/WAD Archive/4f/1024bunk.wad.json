	"description": "This is a simple map I made inspired by the Claustrophobia 1024 series. While tiny, I have managed to make this Multiplayer Compatible. I did originally design this with Brutal Doom in mind, but you should be able to play this in good ol' Vanilla Doom. NOTE: Please limit 2 people in Co-op, & 4 people in DM. Storytime: =A local UAC Bunker has recently gone Dark. You have been sent in to investigate the area & eliminate any hostiles. However, from the moment you walk in the door, you realise that this job won't be easy.",
