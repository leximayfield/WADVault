	"description": "There's a main room surrounded by hallways and windows of different heights, hence the name. There's also the usual courtyard, athough I don't expect it gets TOO much use. I do like the effect of the flashing stairs, though. There's also a couple of sneaky one way doors leading out to two different sides of an outside area. This is where the big guns are. It is possible to screw up the one way doors, but I did leave a way to fix it. Somebody has to die, though. Sorry about that. By the way, it is possible to jump into the pit of slime in the dark room from the top of the wide staircase, although I don't know why you'd want to. I don't know why I did.",
