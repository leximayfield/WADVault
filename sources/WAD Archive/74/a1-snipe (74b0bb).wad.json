	"description": "Set in a snipers haven, you and your Fragpals must fight it out in buildings surrounded by water, connected by passages. There are so many windows and look-out spots in this level, that you'll never be safe. Oh no... never! NEVER! MUHUUHHAHAHAHAHAHAH!! Erm... sorry... anyway, A1 started the level design, and Kowalski finished it off... BTW: The Enya music has been added so that, at least when your left ventricle is having spasms due to the plasma shots hitting your chest, and your mouth is filling with the salt water around you, you know that if you just relax, you'll probably be ok. ;)",
