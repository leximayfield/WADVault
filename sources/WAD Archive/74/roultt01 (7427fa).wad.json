Create a map that best depicts a theme generated by jmickle66666666's level theme generator. Themes were created, numbered and then hidden from participants, who were made to select a number at random in order to be assigned a theme. The event ran for just under two weeks, totalling 12 maps. These maps are designed to be played from pistol start.",
