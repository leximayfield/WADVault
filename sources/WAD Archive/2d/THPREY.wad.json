	"description": "I love the two \"Predator\" movies. And when I got a hold of the THEME16 patch that includes Predators in it, I got an idea for a dandy theme level. Just like Schwarzenegger (sp), you're alone in the dark forest, with a Predator (actually, Predators) out for your blood. You can't see him, but he can see you. You can get a sense of vague movement from time to time, but is it enough to target him and kill him before he kills you?",
