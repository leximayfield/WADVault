	"description": "Deathmatch level for Doom 1.666. This level is fast and furious fun for 2-4 combatants. Multiple kill lanes covering each major weapon is a feature of NemoDM. *YES* there is a ship with masts and a cargo hold (thanks DB!) ;) Note: There is one area which is a great spot for sniping, but not easy to find. Look for a U turn hallway with metal textures on the walls. Some of these walls are passable. Note2: Red pad starts the crusher, Blue pad stops it! Have fun! Then Feedback!",
