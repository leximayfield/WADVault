	"description": "Got the idea from the Star Wars Jedi Academy triliogy series. The Mass- assi temples where focusing points for the powers of the Dark Side of the Force. The first Dark Lord of the Sith enslaved the Massassi people and forced them to build the temples which were named after them. Thought it would be fun to design a deathmatch level based on some the descriptions in the novels.",
