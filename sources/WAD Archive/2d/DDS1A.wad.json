	"description": "It is a fight every step of the way, and (IMHO) more what one might have expected of e2m1, from the beating you take at the end of the 1st mission. It's got some pretty tricky things in it...but the overall difficulty I'd rate at about 60%-80% (doable). The next installments will be much more difficult. I really want to add a Metallica soundtrack to the whole level to set a more, er, violent tone (this may come along as I find time... any takers?) Let me know what you think (constructive criticism and voluminous praise much more welcome than flames!)",
