	"description": "Small level designed for constant player contact. Abundant weapons are strategically placed.. Lots of strategy in this one, so look and adapt! I'm semi-retired from .WAD making, so I took no steps to align any textures. If this just totally spoils the level for you, so be it, but I don't have the time anymore to devote to making these things. Unless of course, you want to pay me... ;)",
