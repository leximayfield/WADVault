	"description": "The level has under 800 linedefs 'cos it was made on a shareware program. I've tried to make the most of the linedefs available and used almost all of what I was given. The constraints were probably a good thing 'cos it stopped the level from getting too large - it seems to have settled at a good death match size. The single player lacks a bit because of this, so I tried to make up for it by jamming it full of tricks - don't expect to get through it first time unless you're good.",
