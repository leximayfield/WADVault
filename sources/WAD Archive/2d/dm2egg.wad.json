	"description": "Well, first of all I have to apoligize for the size of the final zip-file. I didn't intend it to be that long. However, I thought it necces- sary to include the Demo in it because I really hate WADs that appear to be simply impossible. You delete them anyway after you have tried them once because you don't want to waste all your time practising it. So why would anyone want to download them? Therefore, I wanted to show everyone that it is indeed possible to finish this level even though it takes a long time of practice. So if you can do better in this level, show me!!!",
