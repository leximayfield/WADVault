Yet for some reason I liked it anyways, so I decided to make something inspired by the game. Mayhem Mansion, you explore a haunted mansion full of giant disembodied lips, TV with legs, angry books, and other things trying to kill you for no reason whatsoever, but don't worry because you have your trusty weaponry and magic! The layout and path is similar to Exploding Lips, but with less backtracking and less \"How the fuck was I suppose to figure that out?\"-ness. ENJOY.",
