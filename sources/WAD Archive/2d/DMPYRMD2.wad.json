	"description": "Although this is the second wad I started on, it is the first wad I have finished. (The first level I started on was 'Underworld', E2M7 on PM7.WAD or MAP22 on PM6.WAD. Until I got and used BSP, it had severe HOMs and I could not finish it. By the time I used BSP, I was busy revising 'Demon Pyramid' which was already finished.) It took me a long time to build the level on Doom and then some to port the level to Doom][. It took even more time to playtest and modify the level.",
