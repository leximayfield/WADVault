	"description": "This is a deathmatch wad I made and it's not really intended for single player or co-op although you can play it with those methods. For deathmatch it's probably better with no monsters but I included them just the same. There's a few sniper spots on this level as well as plenty of moving lifts. ;) There _is_ a cyberdemon on the level but he's only there on UV. All the weapons are on the level. Hmm, I guess that's all there is to say about it except enjoy and write me your comments!",
