	"description": "The reason why we don't reject 1994 styled wads is because the people who actually made them put effort into them. It isn't fair to the authors to remove old files that were made/uploaded from the 90's all because the \"style\" isn't all that great. I'd rather download a 1994 wad than a terry wad. ~ Doomguy93",
