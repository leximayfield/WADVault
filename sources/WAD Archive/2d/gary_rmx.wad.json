	"description": "Hi, I'm Gary Gritness, and I reworked DOOM's music with my Roland Juno-60 and TR-606. It adds a cool, powerful early 80s sound to it, while staying as true to the original spirit and coherence of the original and blending just right in-game. Initially, it was a tape-only release (on slikktapes.com), but I just had to do a proper .WAD, and the good folks on the DoomWorld forums suggested I submit the .wad to the archive. On top of the original Ultimate Doom, you can play these fantastic Doom I megawads that would be a good fit to this remade music: - Doom The Way iD Did - Phobos: Anomaly Reborn - Classic Episode - Knee Deep in Zdoom - Invasion - Eternal Torture A huge THANK YOU to the whole Doom community, Tear on, -Gary G www.garygritness.com www.slikktapes.com",
