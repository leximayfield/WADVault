	"description": "This Level represents the ultimative two player Deathmatch arena. There are some (we call it \"galeria\") windows to shoot out and some fine dark rooms and of course a chainsaw-arena (with nasty doors). This level's seize is good for reaching your opponent fast and intercept it. Nothing for wimps who try to escape or hide (you guys will be hunted easily). We haven't tried it, but we think that this level is too small for a good 4 player Match. Cooperative is out and single is lame. Was only created for a two bad-guys slaughter!",
