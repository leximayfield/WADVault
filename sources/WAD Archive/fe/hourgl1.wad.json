	"description": "This is an interesting \"experimental\" level I : cooked up to try out a few new ideas I felt needed : a little exploration, the most significant of which : invloves a very clever use of teleporters to keep : deathmatch opponents in constant contact with one : another. The big room with the trees and the blackwall : texture contains a ring of teleporters blocked from : direct access by these little partitions. When a : player in another section of the level walks over : a lindef, one of these partitions falls and allows : the oponnent access to the teleporter, which, in turn, : teleports them to the other player's location. : I've tried it out a little in deathmatch play and : it has proved very exciting. Another theme I : tried to explore in this one was the use of linedef : triggered hiding places where players can wait in : ambush. If you have any constructive criticism : concerning this wad, e-mail.",
