	"description": "Story: You work for a special marine unit that guards the galaxy from any threats. It is a boring job most of the time, but there are a few times when there is heavy action. One weekend afternoon, you were relaxing on your sofa, drinking beer and watching TV, when all of a sudden you get a call from the team captain. The captain orders you to return to the base of operations immediately and teleport to a research facility, many light year away, so that you can eliminate any possible threats. Once you arrive, you find some of your squad members killed. You then swear to take revenge and kill everything in that location. Afterwards, you have to make the security measures go offline and escape. This is my first wad. It consists of 1 level and it is pretty short, although it has its fair share of encounters and traps.",
