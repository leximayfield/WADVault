	"description": "First in a series of 2 player deathmatch wads. It has a nice center combat area, a unique ledge that will surely challenge those high-speed snatchers, and lot's a weps. Look for walkthrough walls even after your feet get hot. You never know. I've tossed in a few baddies for those who hate finding an empty arena, but it's best with the -nomonsters flag set. Its small to medium size it optimized for 2 players. I'm looking for feedback from 4 player users. Also any other comments to help on upcomming wads. Enjoy!",
