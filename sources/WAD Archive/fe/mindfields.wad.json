	"description": "Hello, everyone! Here comes a very great doom WAD! I've decided to create it like vanila doom, without any new monsters and other stuff as i used in DEFENDER.WAD. Bu-u-u-ut, anyway, this WAD is really interesting. EVEN for me ( keep in mind the fact, that maps were created by me, so i know every secret room, traps and etc ). I worked very hard on every map, added alotta secrets, so try to find them all. As, always, maps are very balanced. I mean, it's really possible to pass it on every skill level ( Have no idea about \"Nightmare!\" skill-lvl, btw i changed its name into \"Natural Selection\" ). I tried to change the music perfectly, so u can feel the best atmosphere. I don't think, that i should create any stories for the certain WAD, because i'm going to work on the maps in GZDoom format, that is new for me. So, there i will make some dialogues, stories, flashbacks and etc. I really recommend u to play on a skill level \"Underground boy\" (= Hurt me plenty). Yeah, don't forget about savings every time u play... I hope, that you will enjoy it, cuz now i think, this is one of my greatest projects. So, every sketch for maps i took from my imagination, that is why these maps are original.",
