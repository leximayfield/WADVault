	"description": "Initially, this edifice of hell was the source of torture and demoralizing anguish towards soldiers unfortunate enough to have been captured by the grasp of demons. With the intentions of producing nuclear based weapons, the demons designed their base to comply with their prisoner's needs. The battered bones of the captives were no match for the work assigned to them. Therefore, teleportation chambers were installed amongst the various sectors to facilitate and speed up production of their weapons. These teleports were easily identified through the use of COLOR CODIFICATION!",
