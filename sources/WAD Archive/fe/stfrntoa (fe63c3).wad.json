	"description": "You've crawled your way out of the depths with your bare hands. Bloodied and cut, shaken but alive. The super volcano erupting brought the forces of hell back to your front doorstep. Now they've got some new additions to their unholy armies. They've slaughtered thousands, ripping and tearing though civilians and marines alike. Turning UAC facilities into portals to hell, letting more and more hellspawn flood the earth. Now it's time for the resistance to come out from the shadows, to take back what was once theirs. Or die trying, let's just say... The odds aren't in your favor. Don't let the darkness consume the light within the last of humanity. You and and everyone else are the only hope humanity has left. We're no longer on the top of the food chain folks. So watch it, or you might just end up as another lamb to the slaughter",
