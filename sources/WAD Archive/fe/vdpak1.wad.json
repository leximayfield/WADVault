	"description": "Well...here it is. We got up to five vdeth levels, and so here's the pak. It's a compilation of vdeth1 through vdeth5. There's also a bonus level on map 6. Juan and I jointly created the bonus level. Look for the secret exit somewhere in vdeth5 (Or you can cheat and skip there, hehe.) I changed a few things about all the levels. Made them cooler. There are a few replaced sounds, and totally new music (the bonus level music you might have heard before though.) If you HAVEN'T played the vdeth levels before, there's a whole bunch of weird effects and secrets all over that you'll probably have to learn. Too much to describe here, but if you have any questions, just drop a line. E-mail us!",
