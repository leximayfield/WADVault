You are prisoned in a mothership for quite some time as your spaceship was captured by your enemies the Alfa Centaurian race. But today the ship crew has gone quite mad. What`s happening? Oh yeah the mothership is under attack! You hope that the attackers are your friends. BAAAAANNNGzzztzzzt! Suddenly the wall of your cell bursts open and one of the ship crew is thrown inside. You check him to find out that he is dead. Now is the time to escape, you pick up his pistol and look at the hole in the wall. Good Luck!",
