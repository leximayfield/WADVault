	"description": "This is a concatenation of some of the Best dm wads, and i have tested a LOT (i'd say about 500). These are all smaller ones for CONSTANT ACTION small enough for 2 player, but not cramped for 4 player. I just hate playing a collection and coming to these humongus levels where it takes hours to find each other. You wont find any large-marge type ones in here. There arent any super secret hiding spots (well, ok there is ONE ;) that usually wreck the game, as i hate those. There are some great new sounds and about half of the songs are replaced. The only ones without new songs are the ones with decent doom2.wad music. The sounds were put in for change of pace, and some humor (you'll see when you pick up a sphere :)",
