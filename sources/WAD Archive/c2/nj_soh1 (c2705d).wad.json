	"description": "Olde replacement for The Shores of Hell - my first \"Mega-ish\" WAD. Released purely because of interest in old, cheesy 1994 WADS. This is probably not the first version of this file, but an early revision. I no longer have the original which I think would be a month or so older. The file date may or may not be accurate. Both the original and this revised file were originally uploaded to the Compuserve action games forum in 1994.",
