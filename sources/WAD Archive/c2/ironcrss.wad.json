	"description": "Deathmatch. No doors, no lifts, no traps, no slime, no secrets... 'nuff said! Just go kill. This is a map based on totally symmetrical, simple geometric shapes. I'm not too familiar with Deathmatch WADs, so I couldn't tell you if this is too big or small for good play, but it is the 3rd version of this map that I worked and reworked until it was fun enough for me. I've spent well over 24 hrs. on it (but not all at one time).",
