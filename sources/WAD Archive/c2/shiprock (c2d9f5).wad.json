	"description": "This level is a replica of the Rose Pauson residence (Shiprock) designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Both floors are accessible, connected by a transport mechanism. I'm still looking for a way to turn off the sound, but for now consider it a feature, not a bug. This new version DOES allow death- match play. Simply start the game on Ultra-violence or Nightmare level and all the stuff will be there. No monsters are present at any skill level.",
