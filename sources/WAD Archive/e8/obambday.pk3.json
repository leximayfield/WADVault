	"description": "I originally created this as a birthday gift for some DoomWorld user... forgot who it was, sorry. There was a thread in the Wads&Mods section and the title said \"happy birthday, Mr. President\", so I assumed it was a mod featuring Obama. It wasn't, but the guy wanted mods for his birthday, and I was inspired. This version is a bit different from the one uploaded to DoomWorld; its got a slightly better first level. Now behold the beautiful plot or whatever: \"A tragic tale of a man who lost nothing, and gained nothing: You are Barack Obama, sumthing-sumthingth president of the United States. It is your birthday and you receive a very odd gift; a gift that will lead to your undoing, when it brings hellish horrors into this world. As they make your house weird and break furniture and people in half, the American public wonders who can stop these demons. Fight Obama! Fight for everlasting peace!\"",
