Even if you've played the original... don't miss this! - New ending! - Cool lighting effects added! - More (new) traps/tricks/monsters - Monsters under the bed! - Hear the funace in the basement running! (ooooooh) - Now takes place at night.... scarry - Added support for multi-player and Deathmatch - Added difficulty levels - Textures aligned / much better looking levels (should have always been) - Did I say monsters under the bed? - Levels flow into each other better (so what) You return home to find your house infested with things worse than your (kids/in-laws/neighbors/cousins... you pick). It's your duty to weed them out then find the passage they used to enter your life.",
