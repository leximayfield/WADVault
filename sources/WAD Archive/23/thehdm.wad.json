	"description": "NO plot in this one guys, Heck does anyone know the plot in Heretic anyway? Not quite as famous as the ol' UAC story. Oh well, it's still quite a good game.So here is THE Deathmatch WAD (my first for Heretic). Quite a nice layout. 105 sectors in there... and my first WAD with monsters. You might want -NOMONSTERS. As for ammo and energy, well, not too much. I don't like Deathmatching when you can stock up on ammo and become incincible. Makes for a much closer (and FUN) DM if you are pretty equal. Secrets: there is one. but you can find that <g>.",
