	"description": "This wad replaces episode1 of the ultimate doom. And just for it to be clear: These are very oldscoolish wads with decent 1994 detail. They have nothing new in terms of gameplay. And The hole episode ONLY uses 4 monsters ruling out the barons in the last level. If you don't like it, whine about it.",
