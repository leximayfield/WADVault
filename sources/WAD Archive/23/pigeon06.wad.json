	"description": "Unlike previous sessions, this used only one session, which happened 2018-07-07. As usual, mappers could use one of three provided themes. Themes were: 1. Use blue, red, grey/silver textures mostly. Other textures can go as support. 2. Lots of curves. 3. No items which can increase player's health and armor to 200%. Time limit was 3 hours + one hour for final touches.",
