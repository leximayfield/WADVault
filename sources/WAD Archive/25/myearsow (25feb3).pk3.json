	"description": "The only thing this PK3 file changes is the fact that EVERY SINGLE sound file in vanilla doom 1 & 2 are edited to be EXTREMELY distorted and loud, hence the name. Can you play all the Doom 1 & 2 levels with this on? Prepare your ears, because this is gonna be loud... P.S. You can use this to prank people if you're a sadistic person.",
