The exit is in front of you, you search the maez for the key. Im sorry for not releasing a doom level for a long time because of problems in thailand with people with guns and I now have a new computer because my old computer broke down early in year and I had to save one and got a new computer for 2000 baht and has nice black speakers with a wicked subwoofer good for techno. But anyway I hope you enjoy this scary level its scary like that ghost forest wad made by some guy. I try my best to make shore that that are not many deadends so it will be easier to beat level for anyone impashient (hope I spell it right, my english not that good).",
