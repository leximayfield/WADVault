	"description": "This level is a recreation of an old west town. There are a ton of new graphics and a new sound. Check out the windows! (hint: try shooting them) All weapons are present (except the BFG) in large numbers with tons-o-ammo. There is a small maze (in the corral). There is a prize in the livery (attached to the corral) but to get in you must negotiate the maze where you will be vulnerable.",
