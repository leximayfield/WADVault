	"description": "A .WAD for DOOM with the intent of showing off my take on DOOM's level design capabilities. The intent is to create a full DOOM experience, containing a full episode's worth of content over the original first episode, while adding in some new assets from various contributors to Realm667, a prominent DOOM modding resource. So far I have a few levels done, and I will update as the episode fills out more.",
