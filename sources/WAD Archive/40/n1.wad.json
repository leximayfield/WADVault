	"description": "I was deleting garbage off my computer, when suddenly I found this old wad. For reasons that I wont list here,I decided to upload this abomination to Doomworld. This is the first (and worst) wad I've ever made. I gave every single weapon at the beginning of the first map, I added too many monsters (On Map01-Map02), and since I had no creativity at the time, I pasted most of Doom 2's final map (Map30) into the end of the first map (Which I removed from the original wad so it could be accepted). I would say Map03 is the most creative map of them all. I lightly modified the original mod so it could be accepted. I changed the name of the original wad, I removed custom items, removed all mp3s, and also fixed problems that would make the wad unplayable. So download it today and give it 1 star.",
