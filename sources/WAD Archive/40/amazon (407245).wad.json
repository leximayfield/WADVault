	"description": "The level was built to depict a forest or jungle. The aim was simply to create an open area atmosphere where the player can have action all the way. The playability of the level has been thoroughly tested to achieve this. The skill level is quite high and there are no keys used, just switches that allow access to places. You may cheat if you like, but it would be your loss. The places in this level are very nice to look at also. Enjoy!",
