	"description": "Hurt is my second ever map. It is a rather huge singleplayer map, that might take up to 1 - 2 hours to complete. It was mainly an exercise in building architecture and getting used to GzDoom Builder, thus please don't expect too much in terms of pre-planned design. The map is quite open, features two completely optional areas and might be a bit cryptic in its progression. It is very moody and features a great track by Artist \"Immorpher\".",
