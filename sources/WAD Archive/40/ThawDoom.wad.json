	"description": "Strange signals are being picked up at what appears to be a block of ice in the middle of nowhere. It was a demon gate. It was too obvious. Your entire squad was killed in a mission to the mysterious iceblock by the demons that infested it. They ate all of your squadmates until you finally woke up, decided to go inside the gate, and get revenge, even if you may never come back.",
