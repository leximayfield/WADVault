	"description": "Lots of traps and pits, teleporting around. Most weapons are included. My first PWAD, so it's a little raw, but I'm proud of it! Made for single player, but good co-op. I haven't tried DM, but it's probably worth a shot (also, If you have advice or information about adding new textures, monsters, sounds, weapons, etc. drop me an E-mail). Enjoy! (:'/)",
