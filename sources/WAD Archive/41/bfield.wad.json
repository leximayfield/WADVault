	"description": "This is a DEATHMATCH level. There are *NO* monsters so if your expecting to play this alone you'll get bored. This is an mostly an open area playing area. It includes 1 fort and 1 bunker. This is best played with two teams of two. Just remember who your teams are. This level has stuff like a snipers alley. This WAD is best played around scenarios i.e. attack the base/defend the base. If your attacking the bunker you have the opertunity to kill the power, which shuts the lights off. Get the light amps. and attack at total darkness. I tried to give each team there own weapon to start with- fort-P.G.; bunker-M.L I also tried to give each team security around their base. Each side has their advantages and dis- advantages. On Hill Fun it is just one big long stairway and a bunch of hills. I made this one for fun.",
