	"description": "An large tech style base with an high ammount of detail, it uses several Zdoom features. Overall an pretty good looking map, much time went into detailing all the areas. First serious attempt in making an non-linear map, im pretty pleased with the results I got. The map has skill levels so it should be playable for all types of skilled players. NOT designed for jumping sorry, you can grab the BFG9000 by jumping for instance. There are probably more things that will screw up gameplay if you jump, thats all and have fun.",
