	"description": "This is obviously an edited version of Episode 1 Level 1. A few needed changes have been added to make it better for Deathmatch. I like a fast and furrious match with little room to hide. That way everyone gets in plenty of \"kills\" in a short time. (something that there never seems to be enough of after you start messin' with this game!) The wall to the left after you come down the stairs has a hidden section that will teleport you to the new courtyard with the big lake. Watch for walls that look solid but aren't! I was nice and let the secret areas show on the map, so... .......go check it out!",
