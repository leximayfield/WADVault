	"description": "My first attempt at a level. A good-looking, fun to play level with some very intense moments. Somewhat challenging on HMP, though unforgiving on UV. Possible to get 100% kills, however. New version; more polished than \"johann.wad\". Fairly linear with very little in the way of \"puzzle solving\". Featuring the IMP Gauntlet and the BARON Arena! Send comments to above address. Watch for TUNNEL.WAD in the future...",
