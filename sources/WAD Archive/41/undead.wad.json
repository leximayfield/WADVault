I don't want to make a story to this map, because i'm going to make a lot of them, so i'll have not enough imagination to come up with. I hope, that i will have enough motivation to create something huge and really-reallyyy hardcore... And i think i will do it. For instance, a company WAD with 8 - 10 maps in it. That would be great...",
