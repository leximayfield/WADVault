	"description": "A small base with four directions to enter. There is a computer station, a key room, a lift and a hell gate. I apologise for crap architecture and/or gameplay, I've only started mapping, so be nice :} Updated: BECAUSE OF PEOPLE NOT JUMPING INTO THE ONLY LAVA PIT IN THE WHOLE MAP AND CLAIMING THERE IS NO EXIT I ADDED A FEW HELPFUL POINTERS WHICH MAY ASSIST YOU IN COMPLETING THE LEVEL",
