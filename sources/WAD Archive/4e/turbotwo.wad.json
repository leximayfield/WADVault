	"description": "After a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong delay, the second episode (sorta) of the long- awaited (sorta) TurboCharged ARCADE! is here (sorta)! Venture across the mountainous realms of the Himalayas and the lava fields of Hell. Witness epic spectacles such as massive exploding barrel structures and semi-monumental wedding chapels. In The Sequel Episode, you do it all, from raiding a Museum to smashing yourself against rockets to bounce them into colored (and often deadly) blocks. And before it's all said and done, better prepare yourself for an epic showdown with The Man himself, (an acronym of) Satan.",
