	"description": "For those who have used swmusfx2 or swmusfx3, this contains some new sounds that correspond to the various graphics patches that have been released. For the Imperial Guard graphics replacements, I had trouble finding sounds so I just inserted a blank VOC. ;) They don't strike me as the type to say much anyway. ;) I also took some of the music from Tie Fighter (Thanks for the help with that Force!) and replaced 10 levels with music from the game. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the new sounds and music!",
