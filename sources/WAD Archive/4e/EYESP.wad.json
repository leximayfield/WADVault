	"description": "This is a SNEAK PREVIEW of EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, a vast PWAD file for DOOM v1.666 that will be coming out sometime in the near to distant future. The SNEAK PEEK includes the first four levels. Approximately half the WAD. The final product will include a new monster - the SUPER IMP. This guy looks like he took a mineral bath in toxic waste. he runs TWICE as fast as a regular imp, and hurls toxic waste at you. He also scratches TWICE as hard. To combat this new terror a PLASMA CANNON will be needed. The Mancubus is armed with one of these in DOOM II: Hell on Earth.",
