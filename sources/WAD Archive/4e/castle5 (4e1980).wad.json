	"description": "This level should challenge you to no end. Many tricks and traps, and a particularly annoying puzzle to finish the game. Many hours were spent removing visplane problems, but in the ensuing hours I've played, it has never crashed. Best played as a single player level, but DM does work, trust me. Have fun !!!!!!!!!!! Hint : Remember the word \"backtrack\"...It might just come in handy.",
