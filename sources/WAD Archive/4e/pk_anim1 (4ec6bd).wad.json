	"description": "If you know the mod by Per Kristian for the Doom weapons to improve their animations, then you can imagine what this is about: It's almost the same, but the following improvements have been implemented compared to the original PerK mod: - Fists: now also with gloves - Pistol: light from the left (like original), visible arm - Chainsaw: has more idle frames - Shotgun: improved muzzleflash, reload frames optimized - Super Shotgun: missing hand for one frame added, minor tweaks for two frames - Chaingun: rotation/firing behavior fixed - Plasmagun: two additional frames while firing - BFG 9000: now also has smooth animations",
