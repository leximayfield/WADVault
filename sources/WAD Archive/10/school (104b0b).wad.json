	"description": "This PWAD is based on the floor plan of the Yarmouth High School. New graphics have been created. I have a 486DX2/66 and this level crawls because of its size. I would recommend something faster. It could be called poor design since I didn't know this level would be so large when I began. Otherwise, I think this a great level. I have been told that this level is a good representation of the macintrashes and general layout of the school. I know the graphics for the macs came from another patch file for Doom, but I do not remember where. Type 'SCHOOL' in the Doom directory to play this level.",
