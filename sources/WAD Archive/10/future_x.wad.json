	"description": "Well, as soon as I got my hands on a copy of Heretic, I started playing it like mad. However, the weapons kind of annoyed me, with all their medieval type stuff. I needed GUNS!!! Therefore, I started working on a weapon replacement for heretic, and now I've finished it. Here it is. However, All the weapons behave exactly like their Heretic counterparts, since I have no way to change the weapon behaviors. Anyway, I still hope you enjoy it just the same. :P",
