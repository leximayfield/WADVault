It's actually pretty tough, especially because of the Dehacked Patch present in the wad. All the weapons (and some of the monsters) are changed to act very wierd, so be warned. Well, what are you waiting for? Play this now!!! P.S.: The level doesn't actually look like an asshole or anything like that. I just named it that for no real reason, I guess. :P",
