	"description": "This level was designed for the the DOOM 1.6 Deathmatch 2.0 regeneration feature. There is only one place to get your weapons (but it cannot be considered a campsite). There are many places to find your heath, armor, and weapons. Most places are difficult to find. That adds to the excitement Deathmatch--Search for both the means and your prey. There is one Invulnerabilty sphere. While easy to get, it should be hard to find. The level was designed to avoid any campsites--(Great resupply places, the other guy knows it and only one way is through him.)",
