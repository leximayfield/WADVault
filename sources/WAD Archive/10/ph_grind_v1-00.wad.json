	"description": "The overlords of Hell, disappointed with their current lack of efficiency, have decided to industrialise the pouring of corruption into our world. To acheive this, they've constructed a pump in a small UAC warehousing and production facility, which pulls blood straight from Hell and then releases it through a metallic maw directly into the Earth. As you're passing through, you must clear out their defenses in order to allow a demolition crew in to deactivate the device.",
