	"description": "\"Long Road, No Turns\" is a complevel 9 map with 21,340 monsters on UV. Tested in PrBoom+, but it seems to run fine in GZDoom without mods and with dynamic lights off. Difficulty settings are implemented. MAP03 to MAP15 contain the individual sections of MAP01; I suggest using those if you want to play without saving or if you want to skip around and check out different sections. Expect that a casually-paced playthrough will take over 8 hours in-game time.",
