	"description": "DeathMatch: Finally after beating the hell out of the Spider Demon you enter the gateway that appeared in front of you. Emerging from the gateway on the other side you notice that it has brought you back to your home on Earth. Entering the front door you notice ammo on the floor. \"What the hey?\" you say out loud. It appears that the same elf that conveniently left weapons, ammunition, health and keys lying around in Hell and various bases on the moons of Mars has refurbished you house in the same manner. Suddenly out of the corner of your eye you see movement. You run outside hoping to see a fellow human once again.",
