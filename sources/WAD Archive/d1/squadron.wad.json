	"description": "Squadron 417 has earned a reputation throughout the solar system as one of the finest two, three, and four man fighting units ever to come out of the Deimos Academy on Mars. As such, your unit is continuously asked to go above and beyond the call of duty. Your mission is very simple: - To go from site to site clearing any and all alien infestations you might find. - These sites could be anything, so you must be prepared for any and all eventualities..... Good Luck, you will need it!",
