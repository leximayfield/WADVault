	"description": "It's a generic UAC base. It has some small office rooms, a dining hall, some bathrooms, a kitchen, a storage room, and a parking garage. This map shouldn't be too hard for a seasoned Doomer. Take it slow and let the monsters kill each other (this mostly applies to the Dining Hall area.) This is the first map I've made in over 2 years. My DM map was the last map I made.",
