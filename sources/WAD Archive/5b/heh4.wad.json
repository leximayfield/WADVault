	"description": "A small little sotry: There were once a small little space marine, no one knew his name, but he had killed half of hell in weird joke maps, slige maps and other good maps. He was started to be bored, so he started his remote telport system up and saw if there were any need for help sometime. When he was searching he found a big weird sector textured with weird green textures, he wondered what it were. He could see something were moving down here, but he wonder what itwas, so he pressed the button to his teleport and entered the teleport, waht he didn't knew was it was hell's biggest depot of creatures, ready to enter earth's cities (again?) and he knew he had to kill them all for not let them rule earth again. It is your turn now, stop them!...",
