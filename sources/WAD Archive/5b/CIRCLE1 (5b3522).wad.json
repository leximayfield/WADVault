	"description": "A Deathmatch only Wad file. A big circle with some partitions and 4 doors that access the shotgun, the chaingun, the plasma gun and the rocket launcher. I also put the chainsaw in the middle of the circle. This Wad is a high frag count wad file. Be prepared to flip your frag counter. This is a pretty simple wad file so it may work well over modem lines although it has not been tested.",
