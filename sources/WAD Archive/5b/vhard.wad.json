	"description": "I have made adrenaline hard WAD and it's called VeryHard. This WAD is probably harder than chillax, but don\u2019t worry, is not impossible because I tested on level UV and it passable. Thinking job is necessary, because you need find tricks. If your skill not enough, then I have made difficult setting. Here some important information: 1. If you want play without or less using save and load, try play difficulty level \"Im young to die\". 2. This specific WAD works only on Zdoom 2.8.1 3. This map havent over 10.000 monsters. There are beetwen 1850-9000 monsters. 4. Your computer must have at least 4 GB RAM, or you try map with less monsters. 5. Advice: Try be experimental, try be strategy save size of battle area, try be tricky. A story: Marine is in a strange place, it seems he is near the gate to paradise.",
