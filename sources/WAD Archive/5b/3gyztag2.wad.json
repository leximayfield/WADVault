	"description": "Set the mood here. OK, the mood, as always is grumpy. :) 3 player Death Tag, with a twist. Try setting it to co-op play, but play it as if it were an everyone-for-themselves Death Tag (this is where the twist comes in, HINT: kill the zombies!). R00lz.txt should be read as otherwise, you may find yourself to be incredibly confused and frustrated. The r00lz may not reduce your confusion or frustration at first, but they may help in understanding as time goes on. Hope hope hope. :-)",
