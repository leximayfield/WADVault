	"description": "I made this map to reflect on the style of the 90s Fanmade Doom Maps. I like that style the most and I wanted to make my first long map since most of the maps I've made are short and lanky. So I decided to work on this single map mod. There's a secret room which was made to look like my workstation aka the place i'm at when i'm making these mods. If you press the use button on the computer it will end the game which is cheating for the most part. There's also a teleport area which takes you to a second exit but you have to fight the Cyberdemon with his army of SS Soldiers. It ends the level as well as the regular exit as well.",
