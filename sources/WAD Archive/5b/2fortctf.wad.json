	"description": "I was bored one day and decided to make a TF level for Doom. Even though TF isn't really out there, I did it anyway. Then when Doombot 4.0 had CTF working I converted it over. The bots run quite well with the nodes, so a match should be quite good. If anybody makes a demo please send it to me. I'd like to see other people play CTF against Boombots. These guys are frig'n good.",
