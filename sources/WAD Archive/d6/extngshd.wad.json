	"description": "A somewhat difficult DOOM 2 map playable with any limit-removing engine. This map was originally meant as a remake of MAP21 of Doom 2 (\"Nirvana\"), but soon became its own thing entirely. The original Sanskrit word \"nirvana\" meant \"extinguished\", hence the level's name. This wad features a custom palette that I made myself. I think that it gives the level a more grim and less cartoony vibe without being quite as dim and dark as Sigvatr's PalPlus palette. A note regarding one feature of this level: If you reach the exit, having slain every monster in your path, and yet the map screen shows that 100-150 monsters still roam the map, you have not accessed all areas of this realm, and thus you have not thwarted the Gatekeeper's attempt to drive you insane. Search harder.",
