There's also a few other nasty thing's I've found regarding them, and that's already fixed. I'll be releasing that later. It'll be a Doom I and Doom II thing, so no separate downloads. Also, I will be putting hte DDFs in the wads so you don't have to make any special directories. Anyways...yes, there's a story to this (gotta explain all the weapons and such, eh? :P)",
