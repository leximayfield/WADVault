	"description": "Oh no! Super Chicken's sidekick Wondeer has been captured by the forces of hell! Looks like it's time for him to save her! Assist Super Chicken's heroic rampage by guiding him through levels while making use of his self-gravity manipulation and making use of his assortment of tools gathered from monitors scattered about! Holding down the jump button will increase his air control dramatically as well as slowing down his descent, while crouching causes him to rocket down, allowing you to piece even the toughest of foes! Powerups are held in the aforementioned monitors that have to be broken. Weapon monitors, those that show only static, grant Super Chicken his offensive powers that can be used by pressing the alt fire key. Nearly every levelset should work with this mod, excluding those that add custom weapons. Some levels may also be broken by the hero's small stature. Additionally, Super Chicken is amazingly mobile while airborne, so you'll have to force yourself to not break some other levels' flow! Whether or not that's a problem, well, that's an entirely different matter.",
