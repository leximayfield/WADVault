	"description": "Replaces the chainsaw with a cool bloody samurai sword. Remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where Bruce Willis and his friend are being held prisoner in the pawn shop? Bruce passes up a shotgun, a chainsaw, then picks up a sword and proceeds to slash up the hillbillies who are taking turns anal-raping the black guy? Anyway, with this patch you can slash up some undead. Enjoy! Oh, and this sword does a lot more damage than the chainsaw used to.",
