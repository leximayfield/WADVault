	"description": "Sorry, there's no lame story that goes with my level... but no one plays Doom for the plot! Slime Tunnels is a dark underground level with a river of slime, which leads to a huge vat full of it. I think it's a pretty cool level - there are a couple of different paths you can take through the level, the monsters are well placed, and it's just hard enough to make it a challenge on Ultra-Violent. Try getting 100% kills, items, and secrets on UV - I can, easily. This level is also decent for deathmatch - when played as a deathmatch level, all the weapons are available. It also has NEW MUSIC - a Metallica song...",
