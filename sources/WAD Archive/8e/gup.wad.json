	"description": "Medium-sized level, built with single- player and co-op in mind. This level features a 95% linear design, challanging gameplay, and good texture alignment. I've tried to make it live up to the high standards set by the kings of wad design - the Memento Mori crew, and the authors of the Master Levels. This is a quality level. Average completion time: @16 minutes",
