	"description": "A HUGE improvement over Siege 1.0 Your mission, whether or not you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate the castle and maintain control of it. Intelligence suggests a strong outside contingent, but no significant defense on the inside. Your main obstacle will be rival infiltrators... You will NOT be given reinforcements. Good luck. Good-bye.",
