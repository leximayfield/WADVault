	"description": "You arrive at Widow's Grieve. It is dusk and not a sound is heard across the forbidding quagmire. Briefly, you consider heading back to Merz's for another stiff one, but some dark magic has silently filled in the tunnel behind you with stone... You curse D'Sparil and this mad quest.
