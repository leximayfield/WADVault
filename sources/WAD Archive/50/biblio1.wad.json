An hour has passed since you closed the building for today, but you remember that you have left open the gas key of the toilet's water (!!). Praying for not having provoked a major fire, you run back to your jobplace and enter in time to close the gas key before any catastrophe could happen.

You swallow saliva and walk to the iron gate hoping those rumors about \"satanist skinheads\" in this town were fake. Shit! In the hurry you have broken the key of the iron gate, and it's closed again by it's own weight. Your only way for getting out of here is to jump from the study room's window, broken recently by a hooligan, and fall safely (you hope) into the trash container below. You remember having hidden the blue keys of the study room in the electric installation room, but they aren't. \"Satanic skinheads\", you think, as you hear some steps in the distance. You take out your gun (it's a dangerous marginal suburb, after all), and you prepare yourself for wathever may come between you and the study room...",
