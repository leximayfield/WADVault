	"description": "Fatal Analysis is a game comprised of two new levels. Both incorporate new and unique techniques in things such as sector lighting, texture alignment and new sounds and music. These levels are tough and interesting due to all of the above. The music compliments the sound and both compliment the level Graphics were not finished in time to be added but are soon to be released to the public as of 1996. E1M1 was created from scratch with the amazing DCK. It has an amazing difficulty. This level will take time to finish. E1M2 is based on a hotel layout in Palm Springs California but has been changed due to nessecity of action and playability.",
