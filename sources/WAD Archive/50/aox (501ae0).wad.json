	"description": "This WAD is based on an AD&D campaign that serveral of my friends and I played for about three years. Aoxozoxoa was one of two wizards who escaped from a high security wizard's prison in the Crimson Empire. A party of experienced adventurers was hired to track these wizards down and either re-capture them or eliminate their threat before they could align with other dark powers. This WAD is a reconstruction of the original dungeon where our party slayed the Archmage.",
