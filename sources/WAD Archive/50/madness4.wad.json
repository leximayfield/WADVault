	"description": "This level is the conclusion to the first three madness levels, with my architectural detail and skill becoming better and better. I know I said that before about madness3, but this time I really mean it. I think I've made my last doom2 wad but rest assured.....this wad is a worthy ending to the series (I promise that this is the final one unless I get some sudden inspiration...which is unlikely). Don't be afraid to play through this without cheating, but make sure you save often. I don't want any emails saying it is impossible w/o cheating, because it's been tested and beaten (with as many as 30 saves). I promise you that you'll enjoy this level and I hope to hear some feedback.",
