	"description": "Level ripped out of an unreleased megawad named \"The Twilight Zone 2 which was rejected by cdrom.com. So I'm going to release the levels as seperate wads as time goes on. The Story (reviewers put this story into your review) \"Oh no, I'm stuck in a lost base!, Help, Help!, Where is The HEALTH? I'm gonna DIE, well I'll try not to be Malcolm. Oh YES!, I have a PISTOL, and I will kill that Sarge, yippy a SHOTGUN, oh no I'm gonna get BURNT by those imps, 'no problem. Oh no I can't find that health! Oh owwh, Hell Knights, DAMN, Demons everywhere where is that Health there it is!, a SOULSPHERE I can't reach it because I have a weight problem, OUCH!, I'll get you Hell Knight, Whaaaaah!, The Marine Died. Will he survive another great battle? The End All the Health is hidden except a berserk strength. There is not 1 health potion, stimpack or medikit in the entire level. All the enemies Are either \"Lost Souls\" or non bullet shooting enemies. It can be done. After grabbing the yellow key, the silver tower outside will create invincible imps to attack you, don't forget that rocket launcher! This is sort of an incredible blend of E1M7 and TNT level 4 and very well joined together. The level was NOT modified from other DOOM games.",
