	"description": "(THIS MOD INCLUDES 3D FLOORS AND OTHER OPENGL RELATED FEATURES. PLEASE, SET YOUR RENDERER TO OPENGL BEFORE PLAYING) The whole purpose of this DM mod, apart from bringing some sort of LGBT theme to the map design, is to introduce myself as a gay doomer with a Doom-related contribution, due to the most of homophobic quirks around the Doom Community. I, myself, am an homosexual person, and find the lack of LGBT presence on the Doom world pretty much disturbing. The mod includes 5 deathmatch maps anyway, which base off on being outside of the typical brown color scheme with a detail color base of pink. New weapons are included, and the gameplay bases off on these along with a new concept present on several of the five maps: camper zones. These hold sniper rifles to camp from and at the same time, the snipers are compromised to being some sort of easy target design wise, so the gameplay remains a bit balanced. Now, enjoy, and don't forget Zandronum is recommended for this, due to just one map that uses 3d floors. (Though it has bridges still on Skulltag for compatibility's sake)",
