	"description": "This is one of the first few maps I made for Doom 2 back in late 2010. It's a medium sized, hellish themed map which shouldn't be too difficult to beat. This was originally supposed to be part of a PWAD that I am currently working on but it isn't on par with my other maps anymore so I decided to scrap it and replace it with something else. I'm uploading it on here as a single level WAD and hopefully you guys can find some enjoyment out of it.",
