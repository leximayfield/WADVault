	"description": "This awe-inspiring WAD features more slopes, bridges, unique environments, unprecedented surprises, action, blood, violence, intelligent monster placement and DECORATE features than any WAD ever before! Come walk through windswept valleys, clear out underground demon cages, kill a whole new group of boss monsters lurking in the waterfalls with your marine buddies, clear out a boatload of hellspawn (literally) before coming across a new \"blood stadium\" under construction. Finally, storm through an infected base and touch the magic door, pass out and awaken to find the base in ruins around you. After an epic war, aided by your marine buddies, you'll jump into the magic gate and awaken in the ABODE OF THE DEAD (a.k.a Hell, but I guess that sounds cooler) and try to take down the most relentless, evil and unforgiving boss monster EVER imagined.",
