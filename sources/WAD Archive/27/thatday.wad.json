	"description": "This is a short map for Doom 2 in Boom format. I made it because I was bored. I worked on it on and off during the weekend, and my guess is that it took probably something about 6 hours (note that this is a rough guess) total to make it. Its up to you to decide if it is any good for a six hour effort.",
