	"description": "Baron from Hell and Hellknight (which is just differently colored Baron) are my favourite Doom monsters. They're really great. But when Doom 3 was realeased I enjoyed new hellknight too so I decided to replace a Doom1 Baron from Hell with Hellknight from D3. The work I've done is presented here, I hope you'll like it. And yes, I know: what are those original legs doing there?! Hellknight in Doom 3 didn't have them! So... they're existing ;) I just thought myslef that they look pretty fine.",
