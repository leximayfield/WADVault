	"description": "The setting for this map is a base located inside a glacier, so \"Glacier\" is not just a clever name. :) Anyway, this abandoned base is a pistol-only level (aside from secrets) and is meant to possibly be the first in a set of maps of some sort. Primarily designed for single-player, but I think it would be great for DM as well.",
