	"description": "Here is my very first level. Tested to be quite fun with 3 or more players in a deathmatch game. Features: teleports, long staircases, imbedded crushing ceilings, dark \"sniper\" positions, and a very interesting \"one-way\" wall, that lets you fire at someone who's going for the BFG. You can see through the wall from your side, but they can't see through theirs. I hope to make a version with all new sounds and graphics. Until then, play this one! Try it out, its not bad! The exit isn't clearly marked--it's a big skull switch.",
