	"description": "This is a compilation of the WADs entered in SargeBaldy's second speedmapping exercise. Participants were given 100 minutes to create a Doom 2 level on a certain theme. This week's theme was to make a map based off this scenario: \"In a strange twist of events, the Doom Marine's small boat has crashed on the shore of a large island full of hungry tribal imps. Hmmm... that toolshed off in the distance might just contain the lumber and tools needed to fix your boat...\"",
