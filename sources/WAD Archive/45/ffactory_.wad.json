	"description": "The first-ever ZDaemon 1-on-1 map designed for newschool play. It's a factory with crates, pipes and a raised office. I've gone for all-new graphics and sounds as well as the layout to create something that looks, feels and plays different to normal 1-on-1. Freelook, jumping and PWO/neverswitch are strongly recommended here, play without them and you'll have a disadvantage.",
