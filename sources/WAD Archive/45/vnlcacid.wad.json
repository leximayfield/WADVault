	"description": "A short pure-vanilla level I did to break up work on a zDoom project. No difficulty settings. It's yet-another-base theme with focus on concrete instead of space walls. I would personally rate it medium-to-kinda hard, but that's me. It's rough using only keyboard controls, but completely possible. Par Time is only about 2:30. It is not designed with play into the next levels (Map02) in mind, and may bug out on some ports. Wound up eating more time than I expected, and I learned (and suffered) a lot under Doom in Doom format and texture limitations. Second or third map I've ever taken semi-seriously, depending how you slice it.",
