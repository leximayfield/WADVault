	"description": "You've been on a survival exercise away from the surveying base you're stationed at for the past ten days. Just before you left the boffins were very excited by what they'd discovered. As you arrive back at the base after the exercise, you wonder idly what it was that the boffins had found. And you wonder why it's so quiet .... Playable singleplayer, co-op or deathmatch. Biggest weapon is the Plasma Rifle in all cases. Low key - most combat will be shotgun, chaingun or double barrel.",
