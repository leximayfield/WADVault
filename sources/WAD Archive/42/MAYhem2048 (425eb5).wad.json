	"description": "After Two successful...ish endeavors, the MAYhem crew is back for its biggest, most ambitious, and closest to on time campaign yet! (Everything said and done before July!) As usual the maps were made in a one month time span (the month of May). Only this time, to commemorate the cultural zeitgeist of the era, all the maps were confined to a 2048x2048 playing space, so years from now, we can look back on one of the definitve passtimes of the early months of 2014! While severerly dating in execution, we on the MAYhem team hope this levelpack will neverhtheless keep players entertained for a long time to come.",
