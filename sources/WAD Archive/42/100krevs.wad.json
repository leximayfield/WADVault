	"description": "You stand moments away from shutting down the final demon spawner that would forever end this tormenting struggle and bring everlasting peace to the universe, but Hell has followed. You've conquered endless realms, shattered their realities, and killed them all more times than you can count, but they've returned again, as they always do. But, this time, it's their true last stand. They think an assured victory is within their grasp, the combined army of Hell's finest against a lone survivor left with nothing more than his fists, but you know better. It's 100,000 to 1. And they don't stand a chance.",
