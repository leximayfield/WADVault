	"description": "A deathmatch level built from my previous Doom2 map \"Hachisch\". Now I've decided to take advantage of some new features from Zdoom/Zdaemon; mirrors, translucent textures, slopes... So \"Hachisch deathmatch\" WON'T run in the original Doom. The map can be quite enjoyable played between two and six players. At least it offers a pecu- liar atmosphere, far from the conventional Zdae- mon maps. If you enjoy this map, take a look to the ori- ginal \"Hachisch\", a singleplayer level for the classic Doom2. It can be downloaded from: http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=13713",
