	"description": "This is a bonus level for the \"Italian DooM\" series: it is a DM map, whose layout fits FFA better than duels. It was originally designed by Toranaga and then revamped and completed by me, Ismaele. It is vanilla Doom compatible, but I suggest that you use ZDaemon to play it on-line. WARNING: The new background music is a .MIDI, so you'll listen to it only if you use a port that can play it, such as ZDoom-based ports (ZDoom, GZDoom, ZDaemon...).",
