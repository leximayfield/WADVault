This was rejected from Gamers.org FTP because it seems they thought there was content of a disgusting sexual nature in it because of the original title. That is , but good for them to take the time to remove it. There is only one sexual reference that is taken from another WAD already in the archive. I must also note that the original title was only an Aqua Teen Hunger Force reference, not meant to be taken literally.",
