	"description": "Rarely do you get a wad released that contains only levels using the Doom2 Wolfenstein textures. In my earliest days of WAD Designing I enjoyed making Wolfenstein themed levels but many were not released. But here I bring you exclusive Wolfenstein remakes of 11 selected Doom/Doom2 Maps using only the Doom2 Wolfenstein textures. I reccomend that you play each level from a Pistol Start. The list of levels are shown below.",
