	"description": "This is my first level created with the help of DoomBuilder. My intention behind building it was to recreate at least some part of the immense fun I had with the Doom series some 15 years ago. Given my meagre experience with the editor, this level might perhaps be considered as a bit crude on detail and decor, but I believe that it contains some fairly ingenious elements notwithstanding - e.g., monsters acting as guard towers, surprising teleport ambushes and fighting fairly large troops of enemies from strategically placed vantage points. Enjoy the experience and let me know your impressions.",
