This level will test your awareness and of course, pit you to survive in many different and confusing 3 Dimensional environments. As you explore the complex of chambers and sewers, you'll find that areas are organized in an intelligent composition. when you see a bloodfall, you can track it to its source. Areas provide visual clues as to what's ahead and what's living there (eg) DIABOLOS is intended to be very difficult and extremely challenging for even the finest of movers. Ammunition and health are sparring so make every dodge and weave count as if it were your last.",
