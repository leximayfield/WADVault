	"description": "This is a WAD of the starship NCC-1701D, otherwise known as the ENTERPRISE on STAR TREK: The Next Generation. It can be played as a normal wad, but is mostly meant as a 'tour' of the EnterPrise. It is not totally finished, and will never be unless someone else finishes it for me. I just added some monsters, and 'cleaned' some things up so it could be released. It presently contains the Brigde, the Battle Bridge, Engineering, 10-Forward, Sick Bay, a Transporter Room, a Crew Quarter, and a Cargo Bay as well as some hallways. It is approximately 1/6 the size of Deck 8 of the Enterprise, the center and largest deck of the Enterprise. Any comments/suggestions/praise on an awesome WAD..:), email me.",
