	"description": "Perhaps the most unique movement in weapon mods these days is the \"theme\" mod. It started off with Immoral Conduct's focus on \"real-world\" weapons, continuing with wads like LowTech Weapons, Operation Mjolnir, and others. I've carried the idea further - nearly every weapon in this WAD file (barring your foot and Glock pistol) is energy-based. Blaster pistols, wave guns, and the Helix Cannon are only a few of the AA-powered flesh-sizzlers you'll come across here.",
