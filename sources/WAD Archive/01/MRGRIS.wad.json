	"description": "A futurist base with a lot of brown and gray tex- tures. I tried to build a pretty and detailed map, within the limits of the original Doom II -this was a requisite of the 6th Cabro's Map Tournament-, and with the action of the classics... A lot of cannon fodder, I mean. This is a revised update of the original mrgris.wad; it fixes a bug that sometimes left the player stuck in the yellow key area.",
