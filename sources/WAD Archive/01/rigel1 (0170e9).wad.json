	"description": "This WAD is my best one to date. Shadow/lighting effects, difficulty level support - the works. It makes a killer deathmatch wad and will work just fine for co-op and single play also. My goal was to defy the common opinion that you can't have a great deathmatch WAD and have it be fun to play co-op or solo also. Well, try this one! :) Comments, good and bad, are greatly appreciated. WARNING: Ultra Violent is REALLY REALLY hard. If you can get through it without dying send me a LMP of it! I'd love to see you do it. It is NOT impossible, just very hard.",
