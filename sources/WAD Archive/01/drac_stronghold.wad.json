	"description": "I made three deathmatch wads a while ago and finally decided to release them to the idgames ftp. This is one of them. In this map, you're going to be fighting in a military base with a central stronghold. Guys in the stronghold are a bit harder to get at, and can shoot your foot as you run past, so be careful. Weapons 3-5 can be found in the level for your convenience.",
