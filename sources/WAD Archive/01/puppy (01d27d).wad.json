	"description": "Still despondent over the loss of his beloved rabbit Daisy, DoomGuy retires to the French Riviera to spend the rest of his days eating cheese and not fighting demons. One day on the way to his favorite cafe, he happens to pass by the local pet emporium, run by a certain M. and Mme. Poulet. In the window, he sees Imelda Barkos, the cutest Yorkshire terrier in France. His heart skips a beat. A kind of happiness he had not known since Daisy's death suddenly seems within reach! But as he enters the pet store, he hears a shout: \"Sacre bleu! Ze Doom homme! Ee must not get ze puppy!\" Suddenly, M. Poulet is blocking his path. Mme. Poulet grabs Imelda and heads for the back door. \"Ha!\" she cackles as a strange green portal opens around the door, \"You weel never conquer our demonic castle! Errr.... not zat ze dog weel be zere!\"",
