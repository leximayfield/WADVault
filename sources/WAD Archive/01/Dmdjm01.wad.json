	"description": "I guess I gotta write a story.. argh.. Basicly the hellspawn have invaded earth again, this time in the Colorado Rockies (not a fan of the team ;)... the military sent you alone because they cannot afford any more casulties after the previous wars with hell... you're resum\u00e9 also helps you get the job. :) A few days back the UAC base radioed in that the computers were acting weird, such as programs closing down for no reason... the UAC hq just dismissed this since Microsoft was the dominant maker of most of these programs... the scientists and soldiers at the base were never heard from again and satelite scans reveiled the enemy (Yes, in this story the scanners actually pick them up!) Inside the base there's teleporting technology which must be how the minions of hell got back on earth.. you must find this teleporter and use it to transport to the source... Hrm.. wasn't too bad for my first storyline :P",
