	"description": "3 large octagon rooms attached by some hallways, etc. Each room has lots to keep you busy. Ledges, pits, windows. No hiding places for you cowards who rather hide than learn. Wad is good for 3 and best with 4. No Co-op starts, monsters or exit. Feel free to edit it to suit your tastes if you like.",
