	"description": "Ten levels which take place in a demonically occupied industrial area. DK Shrine Remastered is an \"old school\" Doom II WAD, based on levels made in 1994-1995. As a result, it has a layout and gameplay style familiar to people who played levels coming out in that era, but with a fresh and appealing visual style. People looking for a WAD with more modern gameplay elements and style may be dissapointed, but those who did enjoy the more abstract, iD like levels which were around during DooMs heyday should find something to enjoy. This WAD is basically my original \"The Shrine\" WAD with significant cosmetic, design and gameplay changes.",
