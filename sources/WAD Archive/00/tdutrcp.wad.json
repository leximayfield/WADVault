Your mission is to defeat the evil forces and go back to hell again to ask who should pay between administering the Marines or you think accountants hell ... and above all, why the UAC has chosen to build the command on the very top of the mountain most of the world cup... (eeww google translate for life yay!) All right, this is a huge, fancy mix of various maps lying on my old, defunct PC, and there was some stuff from: - The ultimate Doom episode 4, I planned to do, here's a part of planned e4m2 - 2 Doom2 demo maps for testing Legacy Engine, here merged in one map (actually, it's the most part of the map) - One level from an abandoned Ultimate Doom project megawad dated 2006 and called \"Doom Reprised\". Most levels have been ripped off and find their own home in various other projects I've done (Hell Underneath, Bleha 2 updated version episode 5, Earth Base MAP09, Doom 2 Unleashed MAP31, OLD HELL SCRAPER) chopped and mixed with original stuff, and this level (e2m7) follows the fate of the other maps of that project... Anyway, it's that lift maze after the teleport in the cell...",
