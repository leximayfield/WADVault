	"description": "I get banned from every Doom related forum. I do not know why. Perhaps moderators and administartors find me irritating. After some flamewars and my banishment, a strange thing happened: my enemies at ZDoom forums said that they received lots of unwanted e-mails containing new passwords. I was accused to be the annoying hacker. Since we all know that I'm a serious, honest and just guy who hates being unjustly accused, this time you have to destroy, spam and hack into that goddamn site and piss everyone off",
