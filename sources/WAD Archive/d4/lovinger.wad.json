	"description": "The Lovinger Outpost is a series of adventures on an alien world. These levels range from green marble fortresses, bleached sandstone aquaducts, the hollowed-out innards of a volcano, a fiendishly designed fortress near the end, and what's left of a once-peaceful UAC retreat in the woods. Each level is mid-sized, and some of them should be especially challenging in deathmatch.",
