	"description": "The first mod about Postal 2 for Classic Doom and im the first in doing it as i saw. The amazing machete, the scythe, the head-popping Sledgehammer... Kill bastards with antrax-filled cowheads, napalm launcher and the secret taliban weapon of mass destruction. Dont awake the fucking monsters, murder them with the metal shotgun with an amazing raped cat and the machinegun with raped cat as silencer... or no? All the arsenal (except the sniper rifle) of Postal 2 and Postal 2 : Apocalypse Weekend ready to exterminate the hell! Ah, and burn the burning hell with the incredible can of gasoline plus matches!",
