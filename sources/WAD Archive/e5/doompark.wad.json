	"description": "An ancient evil has been disturbed at Doom City. The minions of Hell have taken over the parkland estate and sewrage treatment dam in Doom City. They have slaughtered many and taken others prisoner in the city lockup, for they do not want their plans disturbed. Under the park is the cavern of Imps, Demons, and Cacodemons, waiting to be released by the hellspawn. You have been taken prisoner by the foul motherf@#kers. As your captor leads you in to the jail house, you punch him out, confiscate his pistol and blaze your way out.",
