	"description": "Having deepened into Castle Dasb\u00f6urg, the remains of a antique fortress used as \"weak bunker\" in World War II, you find a library as a side room, where monsters reside and a chalice deep inside can very well suit as a souvenir of the visit to the Castle. This is a bonus WAD coming with the Castle Dasb\u00f6urg Community Project in /idgames, hence it is known as a \"side room\".",
