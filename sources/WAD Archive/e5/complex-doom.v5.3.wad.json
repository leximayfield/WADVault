	"description": "It started of as a wad (back in late 06 early 07) that was ment to replace every existing thing in Doom but I figured that was dumb so instead I removed all the pointless stuff I put in back in the day, dumbed down some of the monsters so that they're not ridiculously strong, added a few new weapons and enemies and overall cleaned the wad up a bit. It's basically like Hard-Doom (which is funny because the very first version of replacements was out well before H-D, I guess inspiration took over, lol) but theres much more in it.",
