	"description": "In the deep has two levels to it. E1M1 was the first WAD I had ever constructed. HOWEVER, I have touched it up numerous times and it is as perfect as it will probably ever get. The second, is fairly complex, with a number of secrets. There's a cyberdemon in this one, but there is plenty of room to combat him. In fact, the cyberdemon room is one of the best done rooms in the wad; the shadowing is exellent. Give it a try, and I garantee you'll like it. The appearances of these levels are far from amateur.",
