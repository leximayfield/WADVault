	"description": "This was my first Doom map. My first creation for any game, really. A tipical 1994 WAD -and made in 1994, too-, with random scenery and misaligned textures. Not very interesting, but I know there are players who enjoy ugly 1994 wads... A refined -and much better- version of this map, done in 1995, appears in E2M3 of my megawad NIVELES.WAD.",
