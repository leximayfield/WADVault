	"description": "This wad started out as just one level but it was so big I had to break it up into five different levels for smoother game play. It was made primarly for multiplayer cooperative game play. Playing it on skill level 3 is very challenging (when playing a multiplayer game). I think we died anywhere from five to twelve times on each level at skill level 3. There aren't very any complicated puzzles in these levels but there are lots of monsters and some very interesting traps. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed makeing it.",
