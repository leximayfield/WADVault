	"description": "A 21st century Heretic episode covering many styles of level, both traditional and unusual as well. Having achieved everything I wanted to in DooM 2, I have decided to move on to Heretic 'cos it's just as easy to make levels for it as it is for DooM. (although I will return to DooM afterwards) It's also a great game and I thought of some great ideas, many using Heretic's special features.",
