It's a huge outdoor area with scores of large pillars scattered randomly about; there is a fairly large open area in the center of the level... There are quite a few lost souls flying around, but the main adversaries (for single play) are CyberDemons. Yes, that \"s\" belongs there! Here's what you will face with the various skill levels:",
