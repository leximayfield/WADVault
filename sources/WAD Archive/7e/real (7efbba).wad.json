It started a long time ago (1998), when I decided to make something more serious than TsotsoFX (Which got a rather \"funny\" review at doomworld ;) I started with Deu, with a theme of a base inside a rocks and caves, the player starting from a cave with dead human bodies and destroyed walls. Then I had to remove some ugly detail which also caused a visplane error and much later I continued the project with Doom Builder.",
