	"description": "This is the chilling finale to The Shores of Hell, but with a few extra twists. There are many more enemies and things to figure out. There is an entire section that cannot be reached without TWO people playing. Here is a warning... Even on the easiest skill setting, this level will be challenging. Here's another warning... I created this level on a 90 MHz Pentium with 16 Meg of memory. There are loads and loads of enemies running around. I do not recommend playing this level on your old 386. My 486 66 with 32 Meg of memory was even a little sluggish. I am happy to tell you that I just completed the original music for this level-- my sequencing software is crummy!",
