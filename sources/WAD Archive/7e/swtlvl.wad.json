	"description": "This is exclusively a deathmatch level, about medium size this level doesn't slow down a whole lot.It Was thoroughly and painfully tested (I left many a corpse rotting on the floor) on 486sx/33. If there are any bugs we haven't found any and if you find some , well tough luck :) Have fun and E-mail BAGM14 with criticisms and/or appreciation. Ohh by the way I (BIIGDOG.AOL) am just doing BAGM14 a favor in uploading this since he never seems to find the time himself. The Texture in one of the rooms indicates what BAGM14 intended to do to me during play inside this level, unfortunately he spends more time slapping his space bar then actually destroying my day :) Again, good luck and enjoy",
