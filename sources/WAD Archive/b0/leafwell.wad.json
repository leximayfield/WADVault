	"description": "Once upon a time there existed an amazing little well know as the Leaf Well. Every Autumn, magical little elves, who lived at the bottom of the well, would start making millions of little autumn leaves, and throw them up out of the well. The leaves would float up and up and up into the sky, scattering themselves all over the land, and covering it in a rich brown Autumn blanket.",
