(sings) who cares? for me? C'est La Vie. I love ELP. I think the L has the best solo songs tho. Who knows who i'm talking about? Oh well, if you don't know it doesn't matter. How's life? Good? Shitty? Just remember you'll end up where you are supposed to go, and when you get there you'll go \"hmmmm, here i am\". (i think i've been drinking a bit too much). Anyway, this wad is ok. The first level is straight-forward blasting, (something sadly lacking with most wads these days, well i think so anyway). The second is something like you've NEVER seen EVER EVER BEFORE. Ever. It ain't that great actually but i bet you can't do it with a mouse. If you can, mail me a demo, doesn't matter what version. You know what? I'm going to put a demo in. NO!! don't try to stop me, i've thought about it and my decision is FINAL! Probably only a demo of level one, maybe level two. It'll be v1.666, but it's real easy to change it so it'll work on v1.9 or whatever. Just read the DOOM specs.",
