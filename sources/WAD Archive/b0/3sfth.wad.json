	"description": "What, stupit name?! Ok, so this is my first Doom wad. So there are some things I want to say: 1) It doesn't have secrets. 2) Architecture is on level of original Doom (or lower). Just what I like. 3) You will have only shotgun and rocket launcher for all 7 levels. 4) You will have medikits only in the end of levels. So you better make sure to not get any damage. 5) You will have very limited amount of ammo. Don't miss and make a right choise between shotgun and rocket launcher. And don't forget that pistol isn't that bad. 6) Be careful in level 6. There are lost souls wandering above. 7) Want to have fun - don't quicksave. Level are short. 8) I tried myself in music. Not very proud of it. 9) And I tried myself at drawing. Credit pic turned out awful.",
