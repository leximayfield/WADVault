However, I thought I would make it a map in its own right as I thought it would be an interesting stand alone level. Interesting because of its unusual design and because it\u2019s made in only ten sectors. I\u2019ve read about the ten sector maps Doomworld compiled but too late to submit a WAD of my own. Still, I found the concept intriguing.",
