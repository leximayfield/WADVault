Features an mp3 soundtrack written specifically for it (a high quality download of which can be found on the DW forums post http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/48920-a-world-in-strife-raiding-the-dam/). No real story or npc interaction other than some vendors, just a new part of the strife world to explore.",
