	"description": "When I was 6, which was about 11 years ago, I played Doom for the very first time. I played it on the playstion at my uncle's house.I thought to myself, \"This is friggen awsome.\" Because of my young age my parents did not approve of me playing Doom. But that did not stop me. Our vacation ended and so did my Dooming (oh I forgot to mention that my uncle lived in Fargo Il and my parents and I lived in Sioux Falls SD). Or so it seemed. Whenever the time would arise that I could rent Doom on psx, at the movie rental store, I would use it. I would attempt to convince my parents to let me rent it. Usually I would be out of luck. When I was not playing Doom I would pretend on the playground to be the Doom marine and kill imps and demons with my shotgun. I would even put my hands up in front of my face to mimic the doom hud. As I matured I lost need to pretend to be the Doom marine. But the obsesion was still there, I was yet still denied what I wanted most. I began drawing doom maps with pen or pencil on paper. They began very primitive as you might expect. They eventually started to get more complex as I pumped out hundreds of drawings. The only reason I am telling you this is because the map in this file is one of those maps I drew all those years back. I figure that I came up with this one around the age of 12 because thats when I started using a straight edge. What you are about to play was conjured up out of a demented 12 year old boy who's only care in the world was for Doom. Enjoy.",
