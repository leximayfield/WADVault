	"description": "A map 30 replacement which see's you battling an array of new and powerful bosses rather than the Icon of Sin. Based loosely on the PSX Doom final level \"Redemption Denied\". This was supposed to be created and released on 06/06/06, but was not even started until 6:00, so didnt get done in time as i had work the next day. Then illness, social life, work, TV and cousins getting married delayed it further. At least its being released in the same month!",
