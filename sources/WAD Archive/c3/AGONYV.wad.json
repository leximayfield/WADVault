	"description": "This is a singleplayer map, i tried vanilla for the first time. I usually use hexen format because i like scripting, but after finishing this wad, i concluded that no scripts were needed. I had a bit of trouble with a lift though... There isn't much health in this wad, so you better be pretty good at it. This is my first time trying out difficulty settings. There really isn't a story, but you should have fun nonetheless.",
