	"description": "It's a cartoony, MSPAINT weapons mod for the latest version of ZDoom (2.1.7 as of this writing). This is supposed to be the remake of my EDGE weapons mod, Immoral Conduct: Lizard Edition (ICD-Lizard). There aren't as many weapons as ICD-Lizard but I'm sure people won't mind. There are three new enemies, but they are human enemies, not the Lizards. There will be a full version with brand new enemies that are Lizards. Unfortunately, that might not be ready for a while. Look at the textfile EXTERMINATOR-DETAILS.TXT for more info on the new things found in this mod.",
