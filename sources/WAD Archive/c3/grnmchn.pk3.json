	"description": "A hell gate rose within the Congo Sector's main stronghold and its spawn completely destroyed all of the marines within the area. The main stronghold was built to house \"The Green Machine\" which was deactivated shortly before the invasion. Your mission is to reactivate the machine and regain control over the Congo Sector and its strongholds. The perimeter of the area is too highly protected, so the only way to progress deeper within the sector is by using the hell spawn's teleportation systems. You've been dispatched nearby the Congo Sector inside of an outpost. It's gonna be hard, but if you fail, the war will be lost.",
