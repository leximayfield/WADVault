	"description": "On a far away colony world, a temple was discovered which marked the border between our reality and another, far more sinister dimension which you've already been to a couple of time. We like to call that dimension \"Hell.\" This temple, which was known as the \"Temple of Water\", was clean and pure, holding the evil in check. UAC sent marines and soldiers to guard it, restoring the old temple amd living there like the monks who had originally abandonded it long ago. Well, we _think_ they abandonded it... we're really not too sure, our scientists are still working on the books they've found in remarkable condition in the temple's libraries.",
