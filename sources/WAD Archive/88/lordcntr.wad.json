	"description": "This is one of my early gimmicky levels. The significance of the name is simple - all players start at the edges of the map, and then commenses a mad scramble to get to the centre. Once you're there - guard the BFG warily. Everyone will be after your blood. Great level for the strategists - and the underdog. So, if you've got a friend you can never beat, take him or her on in this level. It's guaranteed to be more even.",
