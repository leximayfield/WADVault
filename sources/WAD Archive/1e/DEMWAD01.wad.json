	"description": "lv01-039.lmp (Doom2, MAP01, UV Max in 0:39 by Xit Vono) plays back with this map, which is also fully playable in single player mode (might be a little bizarre, though). This is version 1.1 (the original was presented at Doomworld Forums). I aligned some of the CRACKLE and ROCKRED textures, so even though some misaligned textures must have remained, they are less obvious, for sure; I made some lighting correction and other cosmetic stuff; finally I made sure the demos still work (lv01-039.lmp and dem1-033.lmp: a new demo by Xit Vono).",
