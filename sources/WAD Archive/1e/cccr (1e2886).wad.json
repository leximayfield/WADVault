	"description": "This level, designed by me, is \"Chocolate-Covered Cherry Rage.\" I gave it that title because there is a lot of red and brown in it. This one is partially inspired by level 31 from Chillax, level 32 from Hell Revealed 2 (\"Playground\"), and level 32 from SlaughterMAX (\"Power Overwhelming\"). This level consists of pumping rockets into imps and arch-viles, BFG-spamming into 4 species of hordes (pain elementals, revenants, hell knights, and cacodemons) while the cybers infight. You also have to deal with the arch-viles on the towers. Once the fight is over, you activate the switches and kill chaingunners followed by arch-viles. After you gather all of the keys, you activate a switch that opens the exit, spawns arch-viles near there, and unleashes the cacodemons. Once all of that is out of the way, you can exit the level (there is a death exit at the end where you have to manually destroy the Icon of Sin with the exploding barrels which also kill you, unless you are invincible). I would love to see others try and UV Max this level.",
