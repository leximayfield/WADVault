	"description": "This is my first official Doom WAD release! Its a temple/mid-evil themed level with a unique concept (as far as I am aware) of a 2048 size, similar to 1024 size, only 4 times larger. The main reason I chose to do the 2048 theme was because all of the levels I have built thus far have ended up becoming extra large, and because of their size, I never end up finishing them. This is a deliberate way to keep me from creating an unmanageably sized map.",
