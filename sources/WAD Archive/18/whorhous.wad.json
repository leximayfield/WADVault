It says that your favorite WhoreHouse has been taken by a horde of creatures from Hell. \" Your own place to relax !!! They will see !!!! \", you think. However, the message also says that the invasion is a minor one and can be easily defeated. So, you grab only your pistol and a ammunition standard load and go to clean the place.
