	"description": "Note: TO BE PLAYED ONLY ON HURT ME PLENTY!!!This wad is harder than it looks, but its a good challenge. Save often if your a novice. I made this short map for Doomers. Began initially as a holiday map for the NewDoom Community. It was re-titled when real life got in the way of the original release-I also added more content because of this. Most textures in the wad are new and original, the ones(some sprites too) borrowed will be obvious. I wanted to put in a \"guest star\" sort of feeling.",
