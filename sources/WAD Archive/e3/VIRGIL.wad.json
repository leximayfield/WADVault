	"description": "VIRGIL'S LEAD is the 3rd Canto in my INFERNO series. In your search for Beatrice, you lost your guide Virgil (the beatnik space-poet) while crossing Acheron. But you've caught up with him again, and he's agreed to lead you through the current way- station (mostly because demons and undead sergeants are not much impressed with Virgil's way with words). \"You can get a lot further with a kind word and a gun then you can a kind word.\" \"You belong to the NRA, don't you?\" Virgil asks. \"No, I'm just a pessimistic pacifist.\"",
