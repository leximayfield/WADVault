	"description": "A 15-level mapset for DOOM 2 that is compatible with the \"-complevel 9\" setting. Features new music by PRIMEVAL and James Paddock, as well as high-quality redone sound effects by Per Kristian Risvik. If the new music tracks are buggy in ZDOOM while using FMOD, updating to the latest non-official revision might fix the problem. I recommend using Fluidsynth, though.",
