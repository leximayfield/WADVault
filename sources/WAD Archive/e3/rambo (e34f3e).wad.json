	"description": "Well here's the story. (Who cares anyway ?!) Once upon a time four UAC-Marines tried to save the human race by fighting the evil forces of hell. Unfortunately they killed themselves in an ultimate deathmatch, so Earth is doomed. But there is still a chance to survive the attack of Evil. John Rambo himself and his three brothers have agreed to save the day. This Sprite-Patch replaces the four Marines with Rambo-look-alikes, wearing a headband (Player-Color) and sunglasses.",
