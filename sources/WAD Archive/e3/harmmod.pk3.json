	"description": "Base file for use in creating mods for Harmony 1.1 or later. When Harmony 1.0 was release I had trouble running it on Linux. My solution was to translate the DeHackEd patches into modern lumps, which allowed me to play the game. I submitted the lumps to t.v., but he didn't want them since he hasn't learn to use the new formats yet. In any case I feel that the lump can still be useful for anyone who may want to create a mod for Harmony (particularly more elaborate ones). In addition I didn't my effort to go to waste. There is one difference in my patch that I recall is that the hand grenades do not have autoaim, but this can easily be reverted.",
