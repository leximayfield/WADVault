	"description": "You enter into a short, high ceilinged corridor, you can hear breathing all around. They are everywhere! Just in front of you is a sergeant, stationed to guard the entrance to this otherwordly redoubt, but at the moment he is facing the other way, no doubt bored guarding an entrance which he knows no sane being would ever use. You must be careful killing him though, a missed shot could set off the barrels lining the wall and bring the whole place down on you. You take a deep breath and step up behind him. Grabbing his head you twist quickly, snapping his neck, and maintaining the silence you know you need, but you didn't take into account the heavy shotgun which slipped from his nerveless fingers. A loud clang rings over the background of monstrous breathing. A sudden silence ... then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.",
