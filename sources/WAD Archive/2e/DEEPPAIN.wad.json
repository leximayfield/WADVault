It's 9 of my best levels all from scratch with one brand spanking new tenth level. All this combined into one mega episode. These levels are designed for deathmatch but support single player, and most are outrageous for co-op. These levels were all previously released before except for map09. All have exits except for map10, but map08 has a co-op exit, so a single player will need the IDCLIP code. Basically I got tired of keeping 10 wads in my doom2 directory, now I just load 1! Most of these maps are based on simple symmetric designs. I don't care too much for asthetics, although, on my later wads I tried to use lighting effects, and more complicated sector combinations. Well worth the download.",
