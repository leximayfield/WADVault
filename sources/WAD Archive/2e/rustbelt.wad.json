	"description": "rustbelt.wad is a medium-sized map with an uneasy atmosphere. The fog that covers the outside and open areas gives the map a feeling of mystery as you go through it. The textures are from the NMNCorp Texture Pack 1 and I used some textures that makes the map look sort of like Quake 1. All of my custom assets I got from Realm667.",
