There are areas with energy and ammo, make sure you enter them; you'll need them. Hint:The blue key is atop the Castle [Min Req. 66 with 8 megs, you can play with less power, but it will be choppy]. ***********************GAME DESCRIPTION*********************** You are assigned the task of finding out what's happenning at the Castle. Attempts have been made to communicate, but to no avail. You enter into a valley which leads to a cave which inturn leads to the excitment. The imps and soldiers are building some- thing in the courtyard. Seek out destroy and then get the HECK out of there. You never know what might be transported there before you leave.",
