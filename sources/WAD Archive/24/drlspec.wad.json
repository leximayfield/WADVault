	"description": "So there was Doom. And there were roguelikes. Then there was Doom: the Roguelike. And now, the iconic special levels unique to DoomRL have their own adaptations in ye olde Doom 2 (or Final Doom). Each map also has co-op and deathmatch starts, and deathmatch-only items. See below for a summary of each map, and what's been tweaked in the process of adapting them. If a level's gimmick has you stumped, check there.",
