	"description": "This is a conversion of the uber-old CMAT wad into a duel wad, in order to experiment an alternative to shoot!.wad. For those that don't know, CMAT was a SSG practice wad taking place in D5M1 courtyard where the goal was to kill a shotgun guy with 3500 hp.. more info here http://www.doom2.net/~alliance/ladder2.html On this conversion both players start with 666 hp and a SSG with unlimited ammo, with a max reachable health of 999 through vampire mode. I'd suggest using either fraglimit 10 or timelimit 5.",
