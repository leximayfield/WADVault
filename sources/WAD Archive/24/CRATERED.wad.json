	"description": "Deathmatch deathmatch everywhere, And all the blood did spill, Deathmatch deathmatch everywhere, And lots of rooks to kill. This wad is based off of my own masterpiece (uh huh) CRATER.WAD. It's a larger deathmatch level, though. But you should see the original. It's even bigger. I trimmed a lot off of the level so it would run a bit faster than CRATER, but it may still bog on slower machines a bit. This level would be GREAT for like an 8 player deathmatch.. But too bad Id wouldn't set it up.",
