	"description": "5 relatively small and action-packed levels. This is my first release, so creative criticism please! The plot: While being alone on Earth, you receive an emergency message from Mars. It seems like humanity is in a big trouble again. You take a look at the exact spot of the message from the big computer at your bedroom. Near the north pole of Mars! You grab your wool underwear and the .44 under your bed, and start inputting the coordinates into your Personal Teleporter. Note: Near the north pole of Mars is very cold! That blue liquid isnt water, while all of it is frozen. Its freezing liquid nitrogen, so beware! Note about the title: Its a finnish slangword for \"hi\". ;)",
