	"description": "I've been mapping for quite awhile, mostly just messing around with doom builder, making small maps which I haven't decided to release. I was bored one day around seven months ago, and this map is the result of that boredom. This is the first map I've ever released, it's a straight-forward blowthrough, not too difficult and it offers around 15 to 20 minutes of gameplay...maybe less for skilled players. I'm looking for constructive criticism too, just a thought. Load it up, pick up the shotgun and have fun! Runs fine in good old Doom2.exe for me, though I still play it in zDoom out of habit. The name doesn't mean anything, my buddy just thought it sounded funny.",
