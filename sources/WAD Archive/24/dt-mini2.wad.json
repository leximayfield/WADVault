	"description": "This is a 'down the barrel' style weapons patch. Some people prefer it that way. Replaces the chaingun, with the excellent T2 style chaingun from Beyond DooM: The Apocalypse TC by Anthony Galica. Also replaces the shotgun with a shorter, sawed-off DooM shotgun. I had these sprites for a long time, and decided to use them.",
