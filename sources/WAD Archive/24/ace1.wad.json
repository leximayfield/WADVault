	"description": "A smallish level with a gothic/medievil type theme which is based around a study/library overun by demons etc. You may use any port to play this level but please disable mouselook and jumping as it was intended to play under vanilla Doom2 parameters ;) It took 2-3 weeks to complete and most of that time was taken learning the editors I used so hopefully its a bit playable.",
