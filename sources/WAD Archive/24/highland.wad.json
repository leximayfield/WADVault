I'm actually pretty happy with this one -- I played it about thirty times this spring before getting bored with it. And it's a 20-25 minute affair. It was originally meant for co-op, but I never got a chance to try it out because my best friend at the time soon became a bit of a stranger. Sob sob I know. PS this is Map 07. I never make maps 01 because the music sucks. Surely you agree?",
