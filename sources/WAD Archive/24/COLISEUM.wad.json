	"description": "A level that begins when you parachute down near a perimiter guard chamber of an enemy base. Your mission is to make your way through the spectre infested maze to a semi-fortress, and on to an illegally run coliseum. (They use poor defensless Cyber-Demons for entertainment!) There is a hidden self-destruct switch you must press to destroy it. Lots of neat rooms (in my opinion).",
