	"description": "This level is another sequel to Chocolate-Covered Cherry Rage, since it is another candy-themed slaugther level, and is similar in terms of the designs. However, things are a lot different. You have to let the cybers infight with the revenants and once you fire your weapon, it is game over. You would have to rush to the end of the corridor to activate a crusher and a door to another round of revenants. You do it 4 times and after the 4th time is where a big fight begins. It involves the cybers in cages firing rockets into 4 species of enemies. You activate the switches to activate the crushers that kill the cybers and the arch-viles teleport. Once the battle is over, you are clear for exit. This level has peanut butter colored flats and brown, just like Peanut Butter Cake Massacre. The bad news is that there is no snow in it so you are indoors the whole time. If you are not a skilled player, then this one is definitely not for you, so you have been warned. I would love to see others try and UV Max this level.",
