	"description": "Originally meant for the \"#dmclub Channel Project\" that was started last year, Systematic Corruption is a medium-sized e1-themed techbase. Playing on U.V. should result in a ~300 monster count by the end of the level, while the lower difficulties are toned down a bit. However, you will probably still find somewhat of a challenge if you play on your regular skill level.",
