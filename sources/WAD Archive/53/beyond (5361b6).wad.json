	"description": "A few months ago a sect of devil worshippers settled down in your town. There are rumors that they celebrate horrible rituals and even human sacrifices in their castle-like house. But you have not cared much about these rumors, until one day your girl-friend disappears without a trace. You start investigating and find out that the sect had been in need for a virgin sacrifice in order to summon two horrible demon lords straight out of hell. You grab your father's pistol and leave towards the castle to rescue your girl. You enter the house through the ventilation shaft. Just when you start looking around, you hear an unearthly howling. You are too late! Your girl-friend has taken her last breath on the sacrificing altar. The creatures of hell have already arrived in this world. You swear bloody revenge, hoping the two demon lords are late.",
