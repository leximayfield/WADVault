	"description": "Here at last is the Doom 2 version of Castle of the Renegades, the epic e2m1 for the original Doom. I didn't make too many changes in the stuctures of the original, but I incorporated most of the new monsters and some of the new graphics and linedef types. This wad was so long in coming because I couldn't find a Doom 2 compatible editor that I liked that was capable of holding it. Thanks to Ben Morris for allowing me access to beta versions of his excellent editor, DCK.",
