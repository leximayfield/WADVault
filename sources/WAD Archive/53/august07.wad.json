	"description": "A level for Deathmatch only. This (maybe the last?) August wad is a VERY tight level you may compare it to level 07 of DOOM2...just smaller. Call it \"Dead Simple 2\" if you like! :) It's made with the thought that everyone should have a fair chance...that means: no powerups, no Plasma, and no BFG...just some Shotguns and Chainguns laying around...and one SuperShotgun for MAD play!..yes! There's also a pillar in the middle with some Rockets on..but you need to use a Teleport to get on it... You need good movement and good aiming to survive more than 3 seconds! :) I recommend 2/3/4 players, DEATHMATCH 1 and Skill 5 (it gives you more ammo in the weapons) for good gameplay! Hope it rocks on your network/modem; that's what it's made for!...",
