	"description": "The best thing about these levels is they're fairly straight-forward. That is there's no find the key, spend 20 minutes looking for where to use it, 20 seconds of death-dealing, find a secret switch and so on. That's not to say that this kind of level doesn't have its place, it does, but i don't design that. I've had enough of that from DOOM II. These levels (i think) are original. I haven't really played anything like them. Anyway, please see what you think, and let me know. NOTE: The above email address is mine only until the end of '95.",
