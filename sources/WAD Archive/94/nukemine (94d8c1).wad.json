You have been ordered to go in as survelance only. You are to assess the situation and be out in two hours to report to your commanding officer so that preparations can be made for a counter assault. The only problem is, you think your tough enough to take on the army of creatures yourself. You stupid twit! What makes you think that one person could possibly drive off an entire army of blood sucking demons from Dimension-X? Fine then, go ahead...",
