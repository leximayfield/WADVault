	"description": "STAR WARS DOOM!!! Based on blueprints of sets built for the movie and as well as information contained in the SW RPG. These are four of many Star Wars levels I am hoping to do, and I have replaced some of these levels' textures with my own. I will be replacing MANY more of these in the next edition. Any switches found in turbolifts are endlevel switches. Doors needing keys aren't marked by colors primarily because I wanted the levels to look as much like the movies as possible.",
