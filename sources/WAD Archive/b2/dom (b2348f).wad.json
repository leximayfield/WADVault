	"description": "It was a loooong time ago that I released E1M3 \"No Quarter\" of the Doomed Once More project as a \"teaser\" level for what I'd hoped would some day be a full episode replacement. Unfortunately, that day never came to be. I made a few more levels, but since then I've been falling in and out of the Doom Community. Just today, I thought what the hell, I spent too much time on this to never release it. I mean who am I kidding, I'm never going to finish four more maps. So here it is, the Doomed Once More project as finished as it's ever going to be.",
