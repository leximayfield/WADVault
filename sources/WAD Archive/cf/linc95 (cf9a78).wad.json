	"description": "This level was used in the doom2 tourney at the Lincon95 convent. It's a deathmatch only with all weapons but the hideous BFG ( the plasma dosn't have to much ammo either ). And there is no exit, so if you wich to se who fragged who most times, we recomend a time limit. One last thing, the arrows points at elevators just push the walls and they go down.",
