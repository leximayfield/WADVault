	"description": "My second deathmatch WAD. It can be played single player, but it's not as fun. Cooperative mode would be nice, but the intent is for deathmatch. The level is a semi-maze of catwalks over slime pits. (This has a somewhat sewer setting) There is a spawn cube, plus some other misc monsters. (and YES, there IS an exit)",
