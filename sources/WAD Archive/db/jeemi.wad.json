	"description": "3 level map pack meant for gzDoom. May work with zDoom, have not tried it. Jumping is enabled though jumping is not meant to be used, everything can be 100%ed without jumping. Difficulty levels are not implemented either. It is kind of slaughtermap-ish, but it shouldn't be too difficult. Don't fall into acid. This is my first real \"map pack\", though I have fiddled around with smaller stuff before.",
