	"description": "Just like Dutch (Arnold Schwartzenegger) in the movie PREDATOR you're up against a formidable, semi-invisible enemy. Also like the movie, you've got a few of your buddies to help, but they don't have your skills and soon it will be just you against the Predators - that's right, there's more than one this time! But it gets worse .... there's also Aliens and Terminators (from their respective movies: Aliens and The Terminator) trying to stop you from achieving your main goal - rescue the hostage.",
