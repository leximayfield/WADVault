	"description": "Ultimately a Level for the single player. BUT !!!! Also is good for Deathmatch, and co op. Great for 4 player, although I have never played more than two. :( Lots of nice little spots to stand back, and realise just how beatiful DOOM really is. The Reason I don't add all my levels together is because, there single levels, single ideas. I name them AXE, because you will know there from me. STORY : You arrive early to the Starbase out on the far reaches of the explored Galaxy, In sector 777. Having been sent here, to investergate the First and only Worm hole. You are at the least to say, excited. Unbeknowinced to you, the \"Worm hole\", is really a rip in Dimentional space. Providing a gateway to a Place that wasn't meant to be investergated. Let alone Destroyed. !!!!!",
