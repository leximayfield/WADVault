	"description": "After the mayhem that I was just put through, I could no longer stay in that cell I called a home. All the blood shead, the nightmares still haunted me. I decided to move on and start a life elsewhere. I thought, I could take on just about anything. Suddenly I blacked out. When I awoke I found the back of my head to be bleeding. Someone had knocked me unconciuos. It seems as though I had been left for dead. A trail of blood was in front of me. If I was going to find out just who brought me here, I would have to follow the trail of blood. For the trial of blood would be my only way out.",
