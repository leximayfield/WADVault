	"description": "This wad was originally created for an ancient project called the 9th Gate. It has been about 5 years in the making and I finished this level like 3 years ago! (It took a long time, but I finally finished it and was pleased with it). I've replayed the level today and I thought it would be a good idea to release it as I spent a lot of time on this and the 9th Gate is taking far too long to finish.",
