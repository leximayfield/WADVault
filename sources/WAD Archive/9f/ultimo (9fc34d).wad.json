	"description": "This Level is a DM ONLY level, but for you total idiots out there who didn't read the above sentence, I have included the cooperative starts, but they serve no purpose because there ain't no exit!!!!! ANYWAY, this wad has five arenas, one center area with the rocket launcher, and four slightly smaller areas around the perimeter. All the areas are connected to each other via teleport or door, so it's extremely hard to get trapped in this level. HAVE FUN!!!",
