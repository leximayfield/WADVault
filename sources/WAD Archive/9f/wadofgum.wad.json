	"description": "Like most wads you'll see, this is my first attempt at building a wad. I tried to keep it small but difficult without simply throwing monsters at the player (with one exception, but we'll get to that later). There are two puzzle rooms, a couple of rooms that I used to learn about how Doom does stuff, and my journeyman project: a diabolical courtroom. My advice to someone playing the game: there is a room where you can get irrevocably stuck, so save your game often.",
