	"description": "Arieken and I have been getting fed up with boring old traps that usually come in levels these days. This inspired me to start this Wad. This wad is loaded with complete 'freakout' traps, above and beyond simple crushing ceilings and tripcord-opens-monster -doors traps. Brains ARE required, as you must solve twisted puzzles and evade dangerous bosses if you wish to get out of this level alive.",
