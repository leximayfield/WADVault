	"description": "Inspired by caustlab.wad, infebase.wad, here comes a small map I made with GZDoom Builder. I made it within about a month, and I had to fit it in with my personal life, and terry-wads. But you haven't seen anything like this before from me, with fun boss battles, nice detailing, and most importantly, difficulty.",
