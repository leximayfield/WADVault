	"description": "Oreo Cake Massacre is a huge slaughter level that consist of mainly brown and white, resembling an Oreo cake, with 25K enemies. You will need a ZDoom-driven Doom engine to play the level (such as ZDoom, GZDoom, Zandronum, etc.). You will need a good video card because if not, you may not have a pleasurable experience playing the level. Textures used include sf2012-tex, cc4-tex, GOTHICTX, NB_RECOL, and q1tex. If you do not like slaughter levels, this one is certainly not for you. Music comes from level 20 from Italo Doom. Updated on 12-21-2017 (removed unused textures, reorganized textures in the textures lump to fix the issues with animation, added the Doom 3 sound pack into the wad file to spice it up). Demo of this level is found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3asGTqcNjJ0&t=16663s",
