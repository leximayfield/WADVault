	"description": "This version is MUCH neater than the previous one. Instead of literally hundreds of pictures that would have to be in the Heretic directory and a DMGraph program which can permanently change your iwad, there is one sprites file with a deusf pro- gram that simply merges the sprites file into the iwad and can easily restore it when you are finished playing with the new pictures. It is a great deal faster as well. I also de- leted carnage.doc, which was basically useless anyway.",
