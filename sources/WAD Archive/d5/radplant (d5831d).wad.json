	"description": "Large radioactive substance processing plant that's been overrun by hell-spawn. Large, open- plan warehouse section. Ideal for the Doomer looking for a bit of a blast. Also suits co-op netplay (like anyone plays it), but probably a no-no for deathmatch (I woulda made a dm wad, but... long story). It's a bit linear, but hey, it's only my first wad, so go easy! You'll have to look real hard to find the super-shotgun without cheating.",
