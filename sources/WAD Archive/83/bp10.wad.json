	"description": "Your the marine of the year. You take your ship to back to Earth when all of the sudden you speed up. Lights flash everywhere and then you find your self swimming in acid blood. As your armour starts to wear off you get a message on your wrist computer. \"Theres a head in the middle of the blood pit. Theres a teleporter somewhere in the pit. We don't know if it will bring you to the colum or not. The head must be destroyed or there will be another invasion on Earth. The head creates monters. Destroy it and you will be sent back to earth\" You sigh and get ready. Your armour has just worn out. BE CARFUL!",
