	"description": "Exomoon (aka Moonblood X) is a megawad for Doom 2. The levels are a mix of the original Moonblood with early BTSX levels. It has the ruins/temple theme with some exotic natural landscapes. Scythe and Mano Laikas also are a strong influence. It has been tested on ZDoom 2.8 and PrBoom+ 2.5.1.3.",
