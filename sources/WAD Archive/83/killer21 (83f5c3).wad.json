	"description": "After playing many wads in deathmatch mode, I decided it was time to try to create one of my own. This level has many sniping places. There is a central teleportation room that takes you to the other areas. Each area will almost always have a way to shoot at someone in another area. There are switches that allow you to open an area previously unaccessable. Sometimes they open shortcuts to another area as well. As I said, this was originally designed to be a deathmatch level. However, as I got further and further into making it, it got kinda big. It's still a good deathmatch level for 3 or more players, with 2 players being a little bit harder to find the other person at times. There are quite a few smaller monsters, and several of the big guys as well (Most of whom you can avoid without having to fight them). What can I say, the guys I play with like to have something to distract other players so they can sneak up on them even better! It might make a good single player level, but it would be pretty tough!",
