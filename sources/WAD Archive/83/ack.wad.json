	"description": "Takes place after the events of Doom 64, assuming Doom 3's story takes place instead of original Doom's, as well as RoE, Doom 2, Final Doom, and Doom 64. Please note that many objects in the map can be examined. I'll make it easy for you and tell you to check out the red terminals, any notepads you come across, and some other computers in the personal quarters...the ones you can flash so that they stand out a bit. It's an attempt at fleshing out the story, but is also optional. Also, I plan to make many more maps to continue this series.",
