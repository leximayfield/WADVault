	"description": "You are entering the big temple of DOOM. I have build a big temple room, and... other rooms to buils a DOOm level. I've tested it in 'Heart Me Plenty' diff. setting, but I know where are the monsters... so it's difficult to see if the difficulty levels are correctly set. If not, I think the y are more difficult than the ID ones. I can't play via net, so I can't make a multi-player game. I have just put 4 deathmatch starts and 4 players starts, but I can't say if TEMPLE.WAD is a good multi-player level. I hope someone will try and tell me what to do to change it in a GREAT net game.",
