	"description": "Designed to be a deathmatch only level. There no monsters in here (add some if you want) so single player might get dull real quick :-) The level is kind of large, so a 2 player deathmatch might take a while to get interesting. There are five main areas connected by hallways and passages, with barrels scattered throughout (if your lucky you will get to use one :-) Just run around and kill your friends !",
