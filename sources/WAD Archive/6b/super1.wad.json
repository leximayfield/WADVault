	"description": "This is a SUPER addition to MAP 01. Most of the original elements of MAP 01 are still intact, but some changes have been made to make this the ULTIMATE design for a Deathmatch Showdown for 2-4 players, especially on a place like DWANGO! A few secrets lie in this one so I'm not going to give it all away, but if you wish to lock out the BFG, backpack, and the two mega-spheres that exist in this level, simply hit the switch around the corner from the BFG. You'll also experience some moving music, great sound effects, and a replacement title bar screen at the bottom.",
