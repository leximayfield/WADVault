	"description": "Khorus is a 9-level wad, in which you should battle against evil in woods and deserts, caves and vaults, the ancient abandoned temples and catacombs of the forgotten civilisation (that has some related roots with the ancient Egypt's one), and all it - while listening to Russian folk music, or later motives close to them (with a possible small exception). You will learn, why nobody likes cyberdemon's voice, also you will take part in the search of our hero's missing red cow, and feel the Mastermind's wrath, who couldn't expect that despite numerous and difficult traps, prepared for you, nevertheless, you'll break into his den to make the court of Doom come true.",
