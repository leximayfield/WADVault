	"description": "Doom2 SP wad containing 3 SP maps by the above authors. The project originally started out as a \"retro\" mapping project, i.e. for a large group of quake mappers to each make a doom map and then combine them to a megawad. Sadly after the initial enthusiasm of dozens of mappers only 3 people actually came up with a map and the result is this wad. Rather than letting the project die or waiting forever, we decided to release it anyway.",
