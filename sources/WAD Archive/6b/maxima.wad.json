	"description": "This is what I have been working on for the past few months on and off. I have had other issues I had to attend to. That is why this has been slow in the release process. Basically I don't expect much praise for the levels, though I myself find them to be very unique. I did remake the entire player texture including the body and head. I hope the new textures are to everyone's enjoyment. The player head in the status bar now has red John Lennon glasses on. The player body is now wearing a trenchcoat, jeans, and a cross necklace. The levels themselves are fairly unique aswell. The first level is in a cave system. The second level is in a military compound. The third level is in Hell. The fourth level is a room in which you can view the body textures in game. I really hope all of you enjoy playing this WAD as much as I enjoyed making it. Yes you CAN use the new textures, just please give credit where credit is due. I don't ask for much just mention me either in the text file or somewhere noticible. Thanks again and enjoy.",
