	"description": "No real story, I just wanted to make a nice tough PWAD that Doomers could have some fun with. Note that it is pretty tough(especially skill 4) This is also a bug fix for the original eulogy.wad You see, Waded has a crappy internal nodes builder which has a tendancy to leave holes in the walls. After getting someone to record a demo for me, I decided to fix it(it was quite annoying). This PWAD is bug free.",
