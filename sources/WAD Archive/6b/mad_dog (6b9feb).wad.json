	"description": "This is a great level for multiplayer. Playing cooperatively is fun because it has loads of monsters. This level would be fun for deathmatch because it has tons of ammo and hiding spots.I will recommend that it will not be to fun without playing multiplayer.This level has plenty of enemies to kill and many mazes to figure out.It was made basically just for multiplayer.It has many neat looking rooms.I made this level out of ideas for rooms I always had.I made one big courtyard filled with tons of monsters.This big arena was designed for deathmatch but is fun with cooperative too.I got the name of this wad by the fact that there was so many enemies to kill that you go Mad.Well I am not going to tell you much more just go and try it out for yourself.",
