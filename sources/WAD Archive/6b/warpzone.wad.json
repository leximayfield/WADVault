	"description": "This was originally MAP31 in scourge, but after my test release, I removed it, as this level is incredibly different from the rest of the wad, but I didn't think about it too much. After much advice and a few suggestions, it was removed and a replacement made (teleportation), but this level lives on. WARNING - This level is huge and quite well detailed. It may cause slowdown on most machines. The best ways to avoid slowdown are playing with a fairly low screen resolution and (particularly in GZDoom) turning off some of the more fancy effects. To combat the size and complexity of this wad, I've implemented a simple guidance system. If a section of floor, with LITE3 lower textures, in front of a teleporter is raised, then there is something to do there. I'd advise saving every now and then, as I couldn't do autosaves in the map mode I was using, and this map takes long enough to finish as is.",
