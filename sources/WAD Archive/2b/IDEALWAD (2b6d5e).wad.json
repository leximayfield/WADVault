	"description": "I have taken the time to make this [what I feel] to be the most deathmatch- suitable wad. It has open space for great battles, and a lot of thought has gone into the relationship between rooms, platforms, etc. Please email me if you do or do not like this wad! NOTE: This level does not contain the BFG9000. If you want it, you can add it yourself. This is my first wad -- I plan on making more in the future, depending on the success of this one.",
