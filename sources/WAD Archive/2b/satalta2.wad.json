Sataltar good 4 Sp, TFOTEM good 4 all, but the nice thing is that the map is the face of tHa EviL mAStEr. The fIRsT time u play, do IDBEHOLD and then A (or IDDT) to see al the fuckin' map. Or better: launch the level from an editor, so you'll see better the details. Flood is very very very good 4 DM!!! And finally, the best DM WAD in the UNIVERSE...... ARENA!!!!!!! This map is based on another ARENA, but I've changed all the textures and all the enemys, the position of the weapons... In this WAD first I've putted two SP player maps, the first easier than the second. Then, I've putted two DM maps, the forth more complicated than the third.",
