	"description": "Lil' Piggy! The next installment in my \"piggy\" : series. This wad has a similar structure to : piggy.wad yet gets a completely differnet feel to : it as I have added a few ideas to old ones. Use : this wad in 1-on-1 matches for a really \"fair\" : match. I tried to eliminate the \"cheating frags\" : on this level by taking out hiding places. There : is of course some piggy trademarks, namely the : \"quick stairs\", the wood textures, and the BFG : room. Some of you may dislike the BFG, but it : really kicks ass in 4 player mode. Free for all 4 : player or 2-on-2 teams works extremly well with : this wad. Hope you enjoy this map, be looking for : the next level in the piggy series, only from me : and waded. :)",
