	"description": "This is my second WAD. It is set in MegaTox, a toxin factory. The new graphics consist of a polluted, radioactive sky, two new wall textures, a floor texture which bears a striking resemblance to one of the original wall patches, and a subtly (!) altered pallette that adds a green haze which hangs over the factory. I also wrote a new song for this level--don't complain if the timing isn't perfect; the keyboard isn't my main instrument, and I don't have any fancy sequencing equipment. Email me and let me know what you think of this WAD. Try to avoid slipping into the toxic acid! . . . . But you will, eventually . . . .",
