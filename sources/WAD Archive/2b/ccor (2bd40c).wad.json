	"description": "This level is a sequel to \"Chocolate-Covered Cherry Rage.\" Like level 22 from Chillax, you are in a pit with fatsoes on the ground and skeletons on the stairs. However, you are then teleported into a room with cybers and teleporting apes. Once that battle is over, you are teleported back to the chamber. The cybers and the hell knights then come out to fight. Once that is over, all you have left over is the cybers and you are done. This level has brown and orange, which is why it got the title \"Chocolate-Covered Orange Rage.\" This level was updated on 5-12-2019 (removed the monster telefrags).",
