	"description": "This is not intended to be a continuation or sequel to Satan's Lair, but rather, its more of an add-on to the previous level. It has more rooms, some very difficult to find secret rooms, and more monsters than you can shake a chainsaw at! And it's made for Doom ][. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one.",
