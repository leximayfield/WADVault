	"description": "Even UAC_DEAD.WAD is a milestone you should'n miss, it uses a feature which was removed in Ultimate Doom, unfortunately. Even worse, there is no source port available, which can play UAC_DEAD correctly without slight modifications. This is a simple wad which just consists of a MAPINFO lump enabling you to play the original UAC_DEAD.WAD in its intended way with Zdoom.",
