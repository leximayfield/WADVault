	"description": "Watch. Because if your opponent sees you first, he can follow you and destroy you. Listen. Because in this not too big, not too small level, you can be heard from anywhere in the level, through the many passageways connecting everything. Watch your back. Because in this action-packed deathmatch only wad, your enemies can come out of nowhere, from any direction. There's nowhere to hide, no secrets. Just you, and hell. It's up to you. You have to learn how to loose your opponent, then come up behind them and crush them, because in this wad, it's all skill--and the person with the biggest gun doesn't always win. Everything is perfectly balanced, from the monsters to the weapons.",
