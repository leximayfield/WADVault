	"description": "The first map I made for ZPack, which ended up as E2M1, introducing the episode of multi-themed and unusual maps. It was born a reversed remake of the first three maps of my first released project, Scourge. There's a big element of exploring the features of ZDoom here, but the overall result is a free-flowing adventure that doesn't take too long to clear.",
