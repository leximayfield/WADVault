	"description": "We like 3-4 player fragfests, fast and furious. We like DWELLER and DANZIG and KANDY and GAZZARRI (with a little MANCER and AE_TUPS thrown in to keep things lively). If you're feelin' us, then feel these maps. They range from crazy and fast to seek and destroy. They've got traps for folks trying to get the big guns and lots of neat tricks (instant lifts, teleports, windows to jump out of, etc.) for dazzling your friends with your snappy footwork as you come out of nowhere to lay the smack _down_.",
