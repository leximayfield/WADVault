	"description": "A big brown-yellow complex, with some outdoor areas. Also a non-linear map (if the action is too hard, try another route). I've tried some fake 3D effects, and also some Boom features -translucent walls, deep water-. This map follows a similar style to my previous wad \"Hachisch\", but with a more solid theme, and some new textures.",
