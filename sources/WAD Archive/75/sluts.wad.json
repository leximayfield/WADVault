	"description": "The only thing this wad will change is the help page, which will have a sample drawing for my current project, Deadslut.wad or redlite.wad. The final project will replace all dead body scenery ( twitching impaled, dead viles, etc. ) with drawings such as this. This is for good or great (not bad) level authors to look at and decide if this is a project they want to help with. I don't make levels ( I'm more into graphics plus my 386 doesn't allow me to ) and if you do, and can do good ones, I am seeking authors to create red light district levels to acompany my whores. If you want to collaberate, please E-Mail me. If I don't get any response, I'll have to upload the whole thing level-less and I'd just hate to. I don't care how much response I get, the more levels the better I guess, but it just wouldn't seem complete without ONE. If you like my drawing and want to make a cool level filled with butchered hookers, E-Mail me!",
