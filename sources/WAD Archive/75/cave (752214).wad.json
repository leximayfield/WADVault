	"description": "MAJORMUD lovers ATTENTION!! This WAD is a Doom-ized creation of the forest cave in MajorMud! It is possible to play co-op, but there isn't much to the level (the cave is small..), so I reccomend playing it deathmatch , altdeath and nomonsters. This would have been ALOT more realistic as a Heretic or Hexen level, but as of yet no editor for Hexen is where I've checked, (Hexen isn't even out of beta form yet :) ), and for some weird reason HEU decided to quit working on my comp, even if I d/l another copy it won't work! Any suggestions?!? Email me!!",
