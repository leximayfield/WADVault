	"description": "A DooM wad that works in all modes, including Co-Op and Death Match. Consists of many large rooms connected by narrow and dark tunnels. A special congrats goes to all players who end up with 100% secrets and items without using the computer map. Pay special attention to any subtle differences in wall textures. This DooM 2 wad was converted from a DooM 1 wad with DooM 2 monsters added for more blasting enjoyment.",
