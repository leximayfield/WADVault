	"description": "I was listening to the CD \"No Cure For Cancer\" when talking to someone about DOOM, and the idea of making a .WAD came to me. I had played Ash/AoD and the James Brown .WAD's, and found them very funny. But the first time I played Denis Leary DOOM, I almost died laughing (and I died several times while playing, too...). It may not be the best-ever .WAD, but it is likely the funniest.",
