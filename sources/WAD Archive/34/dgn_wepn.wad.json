	"description": "Anyway, a while back, I downloaded the original D-Gun Weapon set, and I thought it was pretty cool. However, There were a few problems here and there, so I went and fixed some stuff and added some more stuff. Well, here it is. The biggest change from the original is the addition of a new weapon: The Glass Shard Launcher. Also included is a new colormap+playpal to change all the blues to cyan and to make all the greens a bit brighter. ALso, you can think of this as sort of a sneak peek of HELLDOOM, because the Glass Shard Launcher will be present there and the new colormap was copied directly over from HELLDOOM. Also included is a Wad that you'll also want to run if you play this with Zdoom. It makes it look and work better under Zdoom.",
