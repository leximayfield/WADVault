	"description": "Your blasting away at a Cyberdemon when one of his mega-rockets homes in on you. The explosion is deafening and your senses go numb. What seams like seconds... well mabey hours later you shake your head and pull yourself up. Staring through a hole in the wall in front of you it, looks like episode 3 on the other side. \"This has never happened before\" you think. Whew!! Safe ... for the moment at least. Turning around you think to yourself \"This looks like a normal neighborhood street\". Until the first fire ball comes flying at you. HINTS The scenic storm sewer is a must and be sure to tour the \"ZOO\". There is an exit but it's someplace you've already been and you can't get there until you complete your \"Tour of Duty\".",
