	"description": "You arrive at Widow's Grieve. It is dusk and not a sound is heard across the forbidding quagmire. Briefly, you consider heading back to town with Merz for another stiff one, but some dark magic seems to have silently filled in the tunnel behind you with stone... Merz curses D'Sparil and this mad quest. You shudder, knowing full well that luck, as much as anything, has kept you one step ahead of the Serpent Rider so far.",
