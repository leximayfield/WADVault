	"description": "One of the best patch of levels ever written for DOOM. Detailed and realistic construction on each of the levels. Great gameplay and realistic effects (light sourcing, smart placing of barrels, etc...) And wait 'till you see Multiplayer mode... Believe me, try these levels, you won't regret it... This is version 1.1, slightly upgraded to fix some bugs and add some things... I also made the levels slighly harder...",
