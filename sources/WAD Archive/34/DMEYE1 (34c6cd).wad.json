	"description": "This is a DooM][ DeathMatch frag fest. It was designed with Deathmatch 1.0 (old) in mind, but is well suited for 2.0 (new) play because of the locations of the various powerups. This is a medium sized level with an intense arena area as the pupil of the eye. The exit (in the nose) is a cooperative puzzle requiring both players to exit the level. This keeps players from exiting out of frustration <G>, or by accident (yeah right). The exit also insures that two players will be equal for the next level, by giving them each a mega, and all weapons.",
