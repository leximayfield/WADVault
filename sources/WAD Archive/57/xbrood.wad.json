Humanity has rebuilt much of their ruins and have already set out to colonize the outer Star Systems with the help of new Artificial Wormhole technology. However, one day the Icon of Sin's corpse had gone missing from it's death site. The crater from where the beast once laid had purple colored glowing footprints all around it. Scientists have studied them and have found that they date to an alien species they dub as \"X\" for Xtraterrestrial. Four weeks later, the forces of Hell has been resurrected by the reborn Icon of Sin and are now ravaging on the Human colonies in the Sol system. It is time to kick ass like your grandfather did.
