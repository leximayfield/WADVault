	"description": "A simple level, layout-wise, originally designed exclusively for Deathmatch, but adapted for one player games as well. Features : - Exiting on Deathmatch is difficult unless you co-operate - Several \"stages\" based in the same area. Just when you think you've finished ... - Last \"stage\" is the hardest, but you can exit without completing it. This level is mainly a shoot-the-bad-guy level; Completion is easy with a minimum of kills, but the aim is to get 100% kills.",
