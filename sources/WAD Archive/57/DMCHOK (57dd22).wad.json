	"description": "Imagine your wandering around hell or earth depending on Which DOOM ya wanna play with and all of a sudden a 6 foot tall chicken jumps out at you and starts throwing eggs at you. Then you whip out you Chook launcher and blow the sucker away. This Rather funny patch replaces imps with taller than usual chooks and replaces the rocket launcher with an awesome shouldermounted chook launcher. This patch was actually uploaded months ago but for some reason it never appeared on all all the sitez so here it id again",
