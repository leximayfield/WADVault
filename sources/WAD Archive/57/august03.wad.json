	"description": "A level for Deathmatch only. It's sort of an \"arena-style\" level and even though it's big, it's quite simple so you still can get some action going with 2 players only. I recommend 3 or 4 players for a good game though. In my opinion, DEATHMATCH 2.0 sucks but I admit that it's great for a level like this so please play this level with DEATHMATCH 2.0 rules. HINT: To get the Rocket/SuperShotgun/MegaArmor you need to *RUN* from top of the cross... and when I say *RUN* I mean running DIAGONAL (shift-forward-strafe)...it makes you run a bit faster in case you didn't know...try it! Note: * skill 1/2 : All weapons available except the BFG * * skill 3/4/5 all weapons available INCLUDING the BFG! *",
