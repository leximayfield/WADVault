	"description": "An abandoned station, placed in a remote location somewhere in high hills. You may consider some corners quite tight, but let me explain. At the beggining I wanted to create a map suitable to play on symbian phones (where you don't have a option to run in DOOM), so the corners weren't a problem. But during the development stage I changed my concept... and this is what you get. Since it's my first release, I would be much thankful for sending any comments about this map. If it is acceptable, be sure to look out for further releases.",
