	"description": "A map I finally finished after starting it a year ago and leaving it untouched until about 2 weeks ago. Theme and basic layout inspired by Map 05 of No Rest For the Living, Vivisection: http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/MAP05:_Vivisection_%28No_Rest_for_the_Living%29 Focus was a somewhat nonlinear level with tight combat and above-average diffuculty. Runs in vanilla/chocolate doom, tested primarily in zDoom. The definition of \"nostrum\" doesn't really fit the map or anything, I just think it's a cool sounding word.",
