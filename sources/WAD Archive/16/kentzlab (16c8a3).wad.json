	"description": "This is a COMPLETE-Episode(1) w/nine levels. : There are 3 new DEMOS, and some added Sound-FX. : I don't recommend cheating, since the maps are made : in a MAZE-like fashion, if you do, you might get : stuck some where, (theres alot of action in the maps : floors/ceilings will block you after passing thru : certain areas). Hopefully, the levels are big enough : for everybody, (it takes along time for one person : to do ALL of the Editing, testing...etc, and I : wanted to finish before DOOM II came out!!). :",
