	"description": "The fifth of the PACKER Deathmatch series for DOOM ][. The first to cater to the new style fragging.... Smallish and tight to limit hiding places, but big enough to keep an element of skill in play. I hate the \"shoot into a crowd\" scenario. Also contains over 20 frames of original animation... --==================================-- This level has no plot, as I find them a waste of time... It has the same basic run and shoot style as the rest of the PACKER series, but is smaller and is a bit more technical. I employed a few new techniques in designing the graphics. I know you aren't supposed to use \"striped\" graphics but they fit the mood, and I LIKE THEM! With no exceptions- all of the graphics are homemade BY ME, or modified DooM originals... Lazarus keeps telling me that I don't have to make ALL new graphics, but I LIKE TO BE DIFFERENT.",
