	"description": "There is no fixed theme to this wad. I just started out making it, and it kind of evolved. It includes some tricks, some good fights, and some nice looking rooms. I mainly used it to learn how to use the DOOM2 editors. It is kind of a mixture of different ideas and effects, hence the name. One theme to keep in mind as you play is CONSERVE! I was not very generous in handing out ammunition and health.",
