	"description": "A remake of the first 3 levels of Doom 2: Hell on Earth, designed for GZDoom 1.1.6+. Features up to 10 times the detailing of the original levels plus Quake lighting, reflective floors, ACS scripting etc etc. Although it is a remake (from scratch, I might add), there are parts of the levels which radically differ from that of the original design.",
