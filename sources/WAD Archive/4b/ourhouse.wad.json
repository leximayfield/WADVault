	"description": "A wad of my house. I tried to get all the details right, and I'm pretty proud of it. I even put the street, driveway, front garden, barn, all the furniture, and even the 200 gallon aquarium in the basement. Here's a little story if you want one.... The demons are back on earth. They come to your house and throw you around, kill your family, and basically just piss you off. The terds lock up the basement and scatter the keys around the house and yard. You want in the basement to get your BFG to blow their friggin' heads off. First you've got to find the keys, though. A small hint - you can go through the kitchen window, if necessary... Go, obe-wan. Kick their asses. Get your gun and get out. Have fun.",
