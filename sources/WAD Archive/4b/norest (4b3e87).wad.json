	"description": "After saving the earth and other planets, you finally get tired of war. You take a job as an engineer in an UAC power station on a deserted planet. Day after day you do your tour of in- spection through the huge underground halls and enjoy the silence. But one day the evil forces strike again. As you hear the well-known horri- fying sounds from the rooms above you, you de- cide that this time it's none of your business. You lock yourself up in a little control room and wait for help, but nothing happens... It's up to you again. Your only chance is to reach the radio station to get you some help. Good luck!",
