	"description": "This is a somewhat large level, so named for its central room with the large spiral staircase, replete with divers* weapons and sundry monsters. All secret doors have slight texture offsets, and there's a computer map behind one of them. I included every weapon at least once, and you'll find each kind of monster save the Cyberdemon and Spiderdemon somewhere in the level.",
