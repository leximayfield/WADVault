	"description": "If I was to tell you that this level is a copy of the science block at Hymers College, Hull, UK then I doubt if you'd know what the hell I'm on about! Hymers is the school I go to, and me and my mates thought it'd be a cool idea to make the science block into a Doom level! So this is it! OK, so you still don't know what this level's like! But do you really think I care??? OK, OK, it's a totally awesome deathmatch level, including tricks, traps and loads of ace deathmatch stuff! There's open areas for shoot outs, and corridoors and rooms for a fast frag-fest! There's plenty of weapons too! Check it out!!!",
