	"description": "This is a simple graphics replacement that gives the Doomguy black gloves, much (or really exactly) like the ones Scuba Steve uses in a lot of his guns. They look quite badass, in my opinion. I made 'em all from scratch by modifying the regular gloves. I also threw in redglov.wad, just for laughs and giggles. It's the result of a mistake I made during the black glove thing. They're reddish-black, but it changes a lot from sprite to sprite. Enjoy everybody.",
