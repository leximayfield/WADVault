	"description": "You blasted yer way through hell and out again, and now you live a normal life. But you start to miss all those monsters trying to get in close to you. So you decide to go back with a couple of friends, carrying a couple bfgs and plasma guns and rocket launchers and all the ammo you could want. You wander towards the portal towards hell, but fall into a hole (while only carrying a pistol) that leads to a hidden regrouping hole for all the monsters that had their homes and families plundered and destroyed by you. They're mad and armed and talking to each other. You learn two things as you hide in a corner. One: this fortress was built out of marines they had killed, and Two: They can see you! \"I can see you!\" Shouts a Former Human Sergeant, a big grin on his face. He hysterically starts blasting pellets your way, and laughing to himself as you here the babbling of those brown things with rabies coming nearer and nearer.",
