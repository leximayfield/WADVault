	"description": "This wad takes a look at a load of old crap I can't release, sees what it likes and uses it to its own ends. It\u2019s also a rollercoaster ride through an awful lot of different themes and areas. The scary part is, this is also a highly planned out wad. Not a sequel to Scars of the Wounded Prey. The aim here was to take the fun of those innocent years back in the 90s, and put them into a more modern wad. Jumping and Crouching required. This map works as 10 levels in one (hence 9 different music tracks (two used twice)) and has thrown realism out of the window so gameplay works like it's meant to. If ammo gets short, it might be worth not killing the monsters that don't have to be, or using alternative methods to kill them if available.",
