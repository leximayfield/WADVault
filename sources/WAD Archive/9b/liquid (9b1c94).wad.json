	"description": "Four Boom enhanced, Quake 2 inspired DM maps. I say Q2 inspired because of the damage sectors, although there aren't any death traps. Not a lot of convayers like in Reclimation(there are two, but they don't mess with gameplay). The maps are focused more on gameplay then looks, although I tried to make them look nice they won't slow to a crawl if you have a p90(at least I hope not).",
