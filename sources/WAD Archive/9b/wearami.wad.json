WHAT ABOUT 3 PLAYER? YOU DECIDE! IF YOUR GOOD DOOMERS..I SUGGEST 1&2. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2 PLAYER & 4 PLAYER IS AMMO & HEALTH. I'VE ONLY PLAYTESTED 2 PLAYER AND THERE WAS TOO MUCH AMMO, SO I PUT IN SKILL LEVELS. THERE IS NO EXIT, BECAUSE I HATE WHEN SOMEONE HITS THE EXIT 20 SECS INTO IT! ONCE I MAKE MORE LEVELS I'LL PUT IN EXITS.",
