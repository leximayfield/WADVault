Well, the first 2 levels were made to make fun of 90s wads, which explains the 90s sounds and HUD. Map03 i decided to step up the detailing. Map03, Map04, and the beginning of Map05 were inspired by UACMC (UAC Mutation Complex), the rest was inspired by KDIZD. Map07 was the longest I worked on any map ever, mostly due to scripting complications. By the way *********** DON'T PLAY ON (G)ZDOOM, PLAY ON SKULLTAG *********** so play it now! NOW1!!!111",
