	"description": "OK, let's give it straight. Doom weapons are cool. Besides one. Besides chaingun. Yes, it's a usefull weapon. Yes, it can save your ass. But why the hell it's looking so boring? Here's something to change it. Dual MAC-10s. It gives Doom a quite new, maybe more \"Die Hard\" feel, but I think it's OK. I resigned from realistic recoil animation - if our hero can shoot rocket launcher holding it like it was machine gun, what's the problem with two small automatic guns?",
