	"description": "The first of the DANDY Deathmatch series. Don't ask me how many are going to be in it... I am not sure!! 5-10 my guess. Anyway when I have finished the series I will compile all of them into one WAD called DANDY!.WAD so be on the look out for 0DANDY!.ZIP, or maybe it would be better to look for 0DANDY02.ZIP at the moment (DANDY02.WAD) cause it is already nearly finished! --==================================-- And now to the level!!! <gasp> This level (and series) is designed for nothing more than DEATHMATCH, and this one for particularly fast DM. NO ARMOUR or HEALTH bonuses. Don't complain until you play, this makes for a much faster, furious, closer and alround more fun DM. Once your down your down there isn't anything you can do about it, and this calls for different tatics. ENJOY IT!!! Sorry 'bout the lack of plot!!! :)",
