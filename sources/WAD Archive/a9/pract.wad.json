	"description": "\"You have been sent to a distant base on the planet know as \"Reaver\" to locate and and infiltrate a recently lost UAC installation, you must head through the place and locate a teleporter that should lead you straight to the intel they wanted you to secure and destroy. Seems like a routine mission, quickly in and out of the place... Right? Well, that depends on how you handle things, there will definitely be a lot of hostiles waiting for you and I don't think your pistol will do you any good against them. I suggest you find some firepower before you even try to enter the lower section of the base. Good luck.\" Practical Infiltration is a single map .wad for TNT: Evilution in the MAP17 slot that is set in the classic old school 90's style of run and gun action. I hope you have fun!",
