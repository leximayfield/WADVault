	"description": "After three successful(ish) endeavours and a year of slow-cooking, the MAYhem crew is back with 34 more maps made in May! This time, it's a very gothic edition of MAYhem where we decided to restrict every level to exactly 1,500 lines. These maps may be black like our souls, but we hope this WAD brings joy and laughter to those who play it!
