	"description": "Map02Mix, is of course, a 'remix' of one of my favorite Doom2 maps, Map02 (obviously). It has a nice 'old-school'-ish feeling to it, so hopefully you'll enjoy that. :D The map was originally started in November of 2005, but I never got around to finishing it, because I didn't like how the map was progressing or something like that. About a month ago, I remembered the wad, so I decided to finish it. It's been finished for a few weeks now, but I just wanted to make sure there were no bugs. Also, when I started this, this was the best I could do.",
