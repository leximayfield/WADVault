	"description": "My wad is a huge canyon with 3 mountains, various caves and tunnel complexes, spiral stair cases, a teleport grid, traps, and really long, scenic views! Ideal for solo play or deathmatch (lots of hidden nooks and crannies, and plenty of room to run around). I think its fairly easy, even on UV, but I didn't make it too hard. I wanted it to be fun. And so it is! Enjoy!",
