	"description": "A dingy castle map in a 2048-square playable area that uses high difficulty to sap away at one's resolve. Of particular note on Ultra-Violence is the dual Cyberdemon clash at the end of the map and the harsh start in the water tunnels where a third Cyberdemon will cause no end of strife. This map originally featured as MAP23 of MAYhem 2048 in 2014. This map may feature a few more resources than it uses, as it was quite difficult to work out exactly how many were relevant from the main project.",
