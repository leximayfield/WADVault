	"description": "You know that crab enemy from Mega Man 9? Yeah, this has nothing to do with it. :P Crab is a weapon mod that isn't fully serious, and it's notable that there are very few weapons that you'd actually find in real life. You can count those on one hand, even. So, you may ask, is there any backstory to this, like Zero Prophet's Zero Tolerance, WildWeasel's Diaz, or even Xaser's Zharkov Goes to the Store? You could say that Crab is an military agency that specializes in unorthidox weaponry, but if your that starved for a story you probally shouldn't be playing DOOM in the first place. :P Also, this is going to be my second wad on the /idgames archive, the first being that stupid \"no pistol start\" thing.",
