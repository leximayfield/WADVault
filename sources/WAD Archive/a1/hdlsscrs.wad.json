	"description": "\"Look to the hill of the Headless Cross, where all witches meet, on a stormy night and the power of darkness is host They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul with and Angel that fell from the sky Listen the screams and the wails of the masses appointed to die Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture At the Headless Cross From the first evil night, when a black flash of light cut the crucifix half to the ground There's been no escape from the power of Satan How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key And the Master of Evil is calling your name Does the talisman protect you from pain?\"",
