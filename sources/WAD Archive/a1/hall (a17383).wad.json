	"description": "You've teleported into the rear of yet another demonic stonghold. Intelligence reports there is a large hall within where many comrads have vanished. The final phrase of your orders bothered you. It said simply \"Lots-a-luck!\" Yes... this is a large WAD but it saves fine. Just don't add any more \"things\" to it.
