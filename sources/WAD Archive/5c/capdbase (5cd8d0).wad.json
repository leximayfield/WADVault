	"description": "This is my first released Deathmatch wad! It is a small, fast-action wad, with a lot of rockets but no energy weapons. Watch my demo to see how the wad works. (Although I forget to get the rocket launcher) But to see the whole demo, you must watch it from command line level, i.e. doom2 -file capdbase.wad -playdemo demo1 I included the very same demo in the wad file, but in the embedded demo1 I get killed by a revenant fireball every time! Weird. Anyway, if you watch the demo with the \"-playdemo\" parameter, you can see me complete the level (with 100% kills) at \"Hurt me plenty\", after a few unsuccessful attempts... with 5% health for quite a long time of it :->",
