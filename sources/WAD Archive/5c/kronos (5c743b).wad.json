	"description": "Kronos was begun in early April, and due to a hard disk crash and a QIC-80 tape error, lost for several weeks, during which DEU 5.1 was released. (And no, I didn't have a second backup.) The tape decided on it's own to work for just one pass 4 days ago, and I did manage to recover the most of my Doom files. <sigh>",
