	"description": "Great deathmatch wad plays great in both deathmatch modes. A remake of my first ever deathmatch level swarmdm1.wad which is possibly the worst dm level on the net. This is much better (at least I think so...). Should be just the right size for 2,3 or 4 players. Deathmatch 1 is recommended. If you want to find good levels for dm check out the MIAMI-DWANGO homepage.",
