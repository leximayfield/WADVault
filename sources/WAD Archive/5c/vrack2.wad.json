	"description": "This is a giant space station in the gray and tech theme. It is crumbling with hellspawn and filled with deadly traps. This is a little more like I wanted to have the original Vrack. More detail, more metal, more big enemies, less linear. I have spent a LOT of time with this level, so I hope it gets better than its precursor. But it was a very hard mission. Vrack was believed by many to be one of the best levels ever created. In most aspects, I think Vrack 2 improves over Vrack. But there are some things, such as the caco intro in Vrack, that in my opinion were perfect - and really hard to substitute :| ... Still, I hope you will find this level enjoyable!",
