	"description": "From the seaport, where UAC goods are delivered, you will find your way to an ancient castle, which is very realistic both from outside and from inside. This WAD is a remake of an earlier version called HARBOR, which was a little too easy to play. There is more challenge in the hurt-me-plenty level, and completing the game in ultra-violence mode now really is a tough task.",
