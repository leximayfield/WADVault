	"description": "Demons recently attacked a UAC Outpost located on Deimos, which also happened to be a laboratory testing the effects of nukage, as well as possible uses. A group of marines were sent to take back the base from the demons, but they were greeted with a nasty surprise... This WAD replaces MAP01 of Doom 2, and is possibly the finest thing I've ever created. Remember, I want you people to see EVERYTHING, not get your asses kicked every other room.",
