	"description": "Revalvicate - A complete Episode 1 music replacement wad with mostly original music from me. Covers E1M1 - E1M9, introduction, intermission and end victory. The majority of Revalvicate is simple but powerful. Not many instruments but they are used well. The idea for the songs was a style not quite DOOM, but would fit the levels. ZDOOM 1.23 or better (or something based on ZDOOM 1.23) is required to play the tracker files properly. I used ZDOOM v1.23 beta 28 to test Revalvicate.",
