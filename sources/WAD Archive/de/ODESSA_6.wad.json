	"description": "This wad is #2 of 17 levels of a large wad not uploaded yet \"LORDDOOM.WAD\". I'm uploading this one to try to get a feel for how they will fare in the Actions Forum. Any 'constructive' criticism would be appreciated. A lifetime(almost) of work(play?) has gone into these wads. Please E-mail me and let me know(either way-good or bad). I have toned down the number of monsters con- siderably (maybe too much) from the original to make it playable starting with a pistol. In LORDDOOM.WAD this is level 6. The setting is somewhat medieval/modern. I do have a keen interest in castles and I think it is reflected in my wads. The scenic quality is pretty good (I think anyway) but I need additional input on playability. An overall storyline is still on the drawing board for the complete set of wads, however this wad's setting is an old castle apparently inhabited by not too friendly folks.",
