	"description": "JP LeBreton does a weekly stream called WAD Wednesday where he plays random files from the idgames archive. The one-year anniversary of the stream happened recently and we decided to do a community map jam to celebrate. The maps are as follows: MAP01/SABMHC01: \"The Great Escape\" by Arjuna Gonzales A recreation of my house circa 2001, the year I first thought of game development as a thing that I could do. Content warning: Alcoholism and the shitty things people do when they don't drink responsibly MAP02/AIRCOND: \"Air-Conditioned Nightmare\" by Fisher A short detour into the psyche of Doomguy MAP03/SEMICAKE: \"Semiautobiographical Cakeitechture\" by Eliot Lash A virtual birthday card",
