	"description": "My first attempt at Doom mapping, and my first proper release for any game. The story is... ...(being made up as I type this)... ...a UAC facility harvesting water from deep rock deposits accidentally tapped into Hell through a misguided attempt of teleporting in new water filters. Naturally this resulted in Arch Viles, flickering lights, and a lack of ergonomic keyboards in the facility. Go forth, and purify the tainted water supply! There are co-op spawns, multiplayer spawns, and multiplayer Things. These have not been tested.",
