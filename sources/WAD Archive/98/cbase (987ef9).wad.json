	"description": "This is a rather small map, it is ment to replace the first map in a megawad, so do not expect high level monsters or weapons, it is mostly pistol fighting weaker opponents (But you may encounter a shotgun hidden in a secret area). The basic design of this map was inspired of the first level of Doom2.wad, \"Entryway\".",
