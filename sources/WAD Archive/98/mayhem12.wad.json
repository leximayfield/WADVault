	"description": "One fine day two years ago MionicDonut decided that a megawad made in one month would be a nifty idea. Then he forgot about it for two years. Before doing so again the idea was pushed forth that the month of May 2012 would be an open call to make some boom maps, and put everything together into one 32-map megawad. What was not accounted for is that May is a busy time for people doing college exams so they can become lawyers and businessmen. Accordingly, only 12 maps we completed by the end of the month. But they are an enjoyable bunch of maps, and we are still about five times more time efficient than the CC4 crowd. At least we have that. The maplist is! 01 - Vigilance By Phobus 02 - The Golden Age By Walter C 03 - Derpman 3D - The Other Game By Walter C 04 - Eerie Canals By TheMionicDonut 05 - Iron Industries By Scypek2 06 - The Metal By Phobus 07 - Red like Jungle By Walter C 08 - Hell's Ravines By Scypek2 09 - The Grudge By Ribbiks 10 - Infiltration By Cannonball 11 - A cold day in Hell By Cannonnball 12- Thematic Terror By Moti and Kongming",
