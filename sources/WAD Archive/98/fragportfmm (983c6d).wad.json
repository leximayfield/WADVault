	"description": "A 21st century DooM 2 episode that is big, innovative, good-looking, and of course, HARD! This wad features desert and mountain levels, and there are plenty of levels beside the sea. There are also city levels and hi-tech levels. But - every style is represented here, even if it is only 1 level! (except the Spirit-World style) For those of you who like secrets, there are at least 3 in each level (except 25-27 and 29-32 where there are none). And you'll be pleased to know that the secret levels are VERY well hidden........",
