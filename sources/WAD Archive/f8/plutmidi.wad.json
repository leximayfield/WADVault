	"description": "One thing that separates the two halves of Final Doom is that TeamTNT composed many original tracks for Evilution, and I think that this added greatly to its originality and charm, even if some of the MIDIs were really short and/or just not that great. So, what if Dario and Milo Casali were musicians themselves, or what if they had other musicians - perhaps even TNT's music team, or even Bobby Prince himself - on board with the project to provide an original soundtrack to the maps of the Plutonia Experiment? This project is the Doomworld community's answer to that.",
