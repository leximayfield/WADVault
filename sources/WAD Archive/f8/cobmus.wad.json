	"description": "So you like Doom and metal, right? You have come to the right place because what is to be heard is some super heavy, pulse pounding metal replacements for Doom 2. There is black, death, doom, thrash, stoner, folk, heavy and a tinge of grunge in the contained WAD. Volume 2 & 3 will come never, as I have no MIDI files to still go through!",
