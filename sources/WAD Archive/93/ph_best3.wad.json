	"description": "This is the third and final volume of Persephone, my \"best of\", featuring 14 previously-released maps. MAP23 leads into MAP23A, B, C and D in a linear fasion with no intermissions, because of how small each map is, so the episode should still feel like a 10-map set. Minor alterations were made to MAP22 and MAP30 to account for the updated slope calculations in ZDoom since they were originally made, whilst MAP28 has had a crusher near the end made considerably less dangerous because I wasn't happy with it in hindsight. MAP27 has had a minor texture change to avoid needing to add a whole extra switch compilation texture for only one use in the entire map set. Of note is MAP29: A Labour of Hate, which was originally submitted to Back to Saturn X as a potential \"Hunter Complex\" map. I've retextured this entirely and removed two walls that were put in to maintain vanilla compatibility, also changing the music. I believe this constitutes the first wide release of that map.",
