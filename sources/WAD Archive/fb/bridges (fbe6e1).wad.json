	"description": "Focused on overcoming the non-3d aspects of the doom engine. This deathmatch arena includes multilevel crossover steping stones. All the weapons are here, but BFG is tough to get to. Plenty of ammo for a gorefest. If you find backpack by searching, I'm impressed. Small enough there is little hunting with two players, but large enough 4 shouldn't trip over each other.",
