Use it to keep your opponent from spotting you as you plan your attact. o Lighting around doors to help you locate exits when its dark. o A temporary trap when you get the night goggles. This allow you opponent to take cheap shots at you. o Teleporters to keep the action intense. o Several lifts (some hidden) o All weapons except the chain saw. o A few one way walls to keep you on your toes. o EXCELLENT design for deathmatch. Play this level once and you will be hooked. o The archetuture is not to complex which speeds up play on slower computers.
