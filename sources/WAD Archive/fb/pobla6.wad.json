	"description": "Number six of the Point Blank DM level series. This one is hard on the limit, but I do hope you won't get any HOM. I once did and fixed it. The level is one big open area with 2 teleporters, a tricky BFG place in the middle and two other buildings to get Rocket & Plasma (in the appropriate skill).",
