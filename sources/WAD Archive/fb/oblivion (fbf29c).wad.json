	"description": "Another oldie from 1996 that I polished up for the modern era (though it's still more or less vanilla in persuasion). This one's been sitting on the shelf for a while -- it's been ready since early this year, but I chose to playtest it some more and then got wrapped up making Firestorm, my other recently released wad. Gameplay is now greatly improved from what it was when I first loaded it up after some 13 years. No story here -- just what I hope is a good, rough romp through some demon dimension cooked up by my imagination given free range. You'll need to activate jumping and freelook to fully enjoy. Cheers!",
