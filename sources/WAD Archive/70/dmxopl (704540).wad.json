	"description": "This is a GENMIDI patch for DMX for OPL3 FM synthesis. This patch aims to remedy the \"weak\" default instruments to better match the Roland Sound Canvas, most notably the SC-55 and SC-88. Recommended minimum setup for no note-cuts is ZDoom 2.8.1 with DOSBOX OPL3 emulator core, with 6 chips emulated. See the README for additional details.",
