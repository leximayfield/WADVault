	"description": "Well, this is another Wad file for Doom2. It has no theme, just KICK BUTT! This file is another attempt at making a good level for DOOM2: Hell on earth. It is full of monsters, (somehow I keep on using the same ones), alot of power ups, (I still keep using the same ones), and I hope lots of weapons and ammo, (I got through it fine, but, I know were everything is). (Just 1 hint; When you get to the exit room, 1 of the exit signs opens the exit door).",
