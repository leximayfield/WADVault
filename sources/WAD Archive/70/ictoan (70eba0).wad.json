	"description": "Well, everyone always seems to associate me with my SHiTWADS series now and some people think that I'm just not capable of creating real maps. So I set out to prove them wrong, heh. Anyway, this is the end result, and I like it. There's no backstory you need to know here, thanks to the wonders of ACS and cameras and such. Anyway, it's a single level thing set in a demon-infested airship type thingy. If you're claustrophobic, don't try this level, as it's really cramped. I made darn sure that the gameplay is still good, though (including a crazy team of betatesters and such). Anyway, I hope this just goes to show you that I CAN make good maps. :P I also went ahead and replaced a few weapons, just because I can. :P",
