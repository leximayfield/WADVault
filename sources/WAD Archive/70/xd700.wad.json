	"description": "Designed for Deathmatch (small, compact and no overflow of goodies). The size fits perfectly for 2 players. Use -altdeath (Deathmatch 2 rules). Single player is possible as well, but only in skill 5 (nightmare). Try to maximize the kills-percentage using the given ammunition (should be >1000% if you don't waste shells and cells as shown in my demo). There are only 6 monsters inside, but watch out. It's not as easy as it looks.",
