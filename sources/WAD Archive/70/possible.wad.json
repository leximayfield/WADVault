	"description": "This is an experimental deathmatch WAD that has some unusual tricks in level architecture. For example, there's \"multiple floors\" and a \"bullet-proof\" window. However, this is not _absolutely_ best DEATHMATCH LEVEL I have made... The level works a bit slowly on slower machines (like 486dx2/50 or worse) because of its complexity.",
