	"description": "I wanted to create something wizardly here, and i wish i : had a little more time to do the final area right, fix : some bugs and add some other stuff but it seems like the : end result got pretty good after all. ;-) : I sent in my level approximately 10 minutes before the : deadline.. which was at 9 AM (local time) that day in : september. That friday night pretty much reminded me of a : typical night before an exam, (total panic) and the final : area with the spaceship was finished in an extreme hurry! : At 8:40 I thought everything was fine, before I (to my : horror) realised there was a critical bug which made it : impossible to complete the level. I simply had to delete : the stuff that wasnt working in order to reach the : deadline. I built the nodes, created a simple reject map : and quickly playtested the level one last time before : submitting the wad and going to bed. I woke up at 8 pm : later that day :-) I don't know what I would've done if : the mailserver had been down at the time or something like : that. : BTW, straferunning through this level is not advised since : i used a lot of linedefs that need to be triggered in order : to have the various sectors \"slide into place.\" If one of : the lines are missed then the sectors might come \"out of : sync\" with eachother so that you wont be able to finish the : level. I know this sucks, but I had to exploit whatever : possibilites i could think of to give the illusion of using : way more than 10 sectors :-) You shouldnt experience any : problems unless you're actively trying to speedrun through : however..",
