	"description": "It is the year 2026, the world is in chaos. There is no clean drinking water for the west, global scarcity, barely any electronics, starvation and poverty everywhere, and worst of all... The corporations that run the world have all the resources they can get for themselves. To do this, they have created an army of Zombies to kill off the population of the Earth. The government along with the corporate leaders have lauched a Genocide Project to eliminate all low and middle class people in order to create a super-race of intelligent and advanced society. As an agent to the Carbon Resistance movement, your first job is to clear out a series of Barracks where some of the elite Zombies are bred.",
