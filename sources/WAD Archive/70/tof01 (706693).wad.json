	"description": "This is an ONLY Deathmatch Wad cause there are no monsters in it. You can still play it standalone if you enjoy it. This is not the first WAD I made but i decided to make a simple level, like MAP01 cause it seems it is the most enjoyable when it is small. It was specially intended for carnage doom. Please send me a mail to give me your impressions or comments.",
