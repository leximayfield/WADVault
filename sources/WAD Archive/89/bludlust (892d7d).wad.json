	"description": "A large Deathmatch designed with 3 or 4 players in mind, but 2 players will have a blast too. Single play mode has monsters, but not many; this wad was constructed primarily for Deathmatches. Take a GOOD, LONG look around before Deathmatch play because of all the secret doors, lifts, etc. Take nothing for granted, a seemingly safe spot may have a false wall nearby hiding an opponent with a rocket launcher!",
