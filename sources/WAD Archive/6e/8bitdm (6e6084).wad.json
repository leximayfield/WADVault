	"description": "This is a try to recreate Doom as it would be done in the 80's :P. My first DM package. So it's not as great as Exec.wad, brit11.wad or dwango serie... Remember 80's? Oldschool graphics from old arcade games? Expect hyperactive graphics and music, fast Deathmatch and a very original concept. It's just weird. Try it!",
