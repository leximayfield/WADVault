	"description": "This level I tried to get a tier effect. There are many hidden doors and Keys.(you will need 2) As in all my wads there is a hidden switch to end the level. Lots of bad guys a perfect level for 2 or more. Look for the key to open the hidden door that leads to the way out. Weapons availability You can get every where but remember teleporters have 4 sides... this means I can send you 4 a different way depending which side you use(BIG HINT) good luck let me know if you like it or hate It. (Chain gun, Plasma gun, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher)",
