	"description": "D9-2-2! Well its finally here, the last 3 levels of the D9 series for Doom2! If I do say so myself these 3 levels are the finest of the series, and complete the 10 level mini episode I have been working on! A must have for any D9 fan! I have included two handy batch files to load all 10 exciting levels when you play. I decided not to group them to save you download time and money. These replace levels 8 through 10, and I'm sure you'll enjoy them. Have fun!!",
