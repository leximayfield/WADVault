	"description": "This deathmatch level is damn FUN. You'll laugh when you see your opponents plummet to the earth if you shoot them out any window. It looks awesome too. This is as 3d as you'll ever get with the Doom engine. The design and atmosphere are jaw dropping. Great wad for 2-4 people. It's small/medium sized and has a bfg secret you'll eventually figure out if you play this wad for a while. There are also many other things that you'll have to see for yourself. Play this with Deathmatch 1, NIGHTMARE!, nomonsters for the best games.",
