	"description": "Coming back from Middle Ages, and having killed everything in previous episode, The Monastery, you feel happy and proud of having helped your friends. Unfortunately, Hell Order did'nt appreciate your valour, and decided to intensify his efforts to heradicate all kind of rebellion. Seeing this, General Mac Porter orders you to go back to Middle Ages, a few years later than your previous raid. As possible as you can, use tricks instead of frontal assaults, because this mission is harder than the previous you completed so well. Rebellion does'nt want to loose one of its best members. Some secret areas may help you, if you find them.",
