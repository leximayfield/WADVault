	"description": "I wanted to put a little of everything on this wad. There are a LOT of remote switches and secrets. Later on I will make some other wads and have a theme for them, but right now I want to know what do you think of this one. I was really careful to avoid HOM and misaligned textures, so if you find anything wrong, please let me know.",
