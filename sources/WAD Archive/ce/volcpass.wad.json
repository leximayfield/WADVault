	"description": "An open, volcanic canyon filled with monster-spam. It's silly, difficult map that shouldn't be taken seriously. Also supports deathmatch and co-op, which the map might be better suited for. MAP02 is the same level with even more monsters. I was originally going to include this in a different wad, but I felt it was too chaotic and out of place compared to the other levels.",
