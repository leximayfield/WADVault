	"description": "This level is designed to be a fast paced deathmatch level with a Doom ][ feel. The level is very smooth flowing. You'll find yourself covering all of the level. The weapon layout was well thought out, so that certain weapons are more desirable to obtain than others. For instance every one will know were you are when getting the Plasma. Since the Super Shotgun has become such a favorite weapon in deathmatch, that also has a slight degree of consequence, but is located so that every one will be going for it. Ammo and health were also major factors. I felt that the super health was just a little to much, so in the exit I put 60 health potions (don't you hate when your screen stays white for a while). And you'll only find the green armor. Loaded up you'll survive a rocket in the face with maybe 20% heatlth (where was that health again). The level has at least 50 hours 2 player deathmatch testing, so everything was debated, from sound (certain sound, certain area), lighting, warp in spots, starting points, weapon layout, health layout, and even graghics. So if your not satisfied with this level, you just don't know what deathmatch is! This level is best played with -altdeath and deathmatch 2.0. One hint is to keep the Super shotgun away from the other guy as much as possible. Also when exiting the plasma room launch a BFG, it'll at least even the score!",
