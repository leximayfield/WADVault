	"description": "Lets Just say that the game play is grueling. You begin in the \"SLAUGHTERHOUSE\" or as the monsters would call it - Home. With many long agonizing minutes of wandering about in dimmly lit corridors and rooms blasting away dozens of demons splattering their guts against the wall, you begin to wonder if the bastards will ever stop coming at you. Can you stomach the idea; dead corpses, hanging and on the ground; blood everywhere?.. Think on it. Oh yeh! One savage beast after another. Oh!! finally the end. Wait.. Hell Knights surround you. It looks like the end..... for you that is If you survive the odds and escape the overly infested house of the dead from hell beware of whats to come. You'll perish for sure. Try your luck at navigating through a maze of white walls and tricky switches while you battle yet another infestation of demons. The automap is usesless and if you're a man you won't cheat!!! Survive if you can.. You may be lost in the maze for an infinity!!! Ha Ha Ha Oh, and enjoy.",
