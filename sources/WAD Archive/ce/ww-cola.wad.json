	"description": "Because we all know DoomGuy is actually a superhero in disguise. How else can he run 45 miles per hour without breaking a sweat, carry immense loads, and run straight over gaps that are nearly 10 feet wide? In addition, \"Mister Cola\" can use his weapons even more effectively after drinking a six-pack of cola.
