	"description": "Out in the middle of Fifi's ocean of lava, you must run across a skinny little bridge while being fired upon by not one, but TWO cyber-demons, among other things. This is just a sample level from my Legend of Fifi wad. It'll have a whole new episode (for DOOM, not DOOM ][) with new graphics and sound and junk. This one is definitely the hardest of the pack. It'll probably take you an hour or two before you can beat the thing, and in between you'll be yelling and screaming like a maniac due to the frustration. You'll see.",
