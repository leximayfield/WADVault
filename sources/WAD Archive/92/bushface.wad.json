	"description": "Bushface (or \"Face of Bush\", as I originally called it) is a silly HUD face replacement. I originally released it in 2004 to Doom Connector community, and now it's 2015 and I decided to upload it to the idgames/ archives so it can be preserved for all of eternity. This upload is in its unchanged form, as I've also found a modified version of Bushface on the Internet. I even preserved the old text file that can be found in this .zip archive.",
