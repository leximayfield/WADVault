	"description": "A DOOM II combo hunt'em deathmatch / single player wad. Rather spread out, lots of open areas with little obstruction. Take a while and explore this wad, think you may find it interesting. Contains 6 teleporter dest's. Hmm...what else, oh yeah a Cyberdeamon and Spider Demon together, should not be too tough though, as the area has good vantage points/ sniper locations. There are no nasty tricks or unsolvable traps. This wad designed for use with DOOM II and replaces map01 (level 1).",
