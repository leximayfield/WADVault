	"description": "You begin on the marbled rooftop of an island fortress. Work your way down two terraced levels, battling all your favorite foes. Note: although the chainsaw & berserk pack are sources of limitless entertainment, they usually serve a dual purpose, (i.e., they allow you to conserve ammo). Remember this. Although the architecture is not terribly detailed, the texture alignment is near perfect.",
