	"description": "My second released DOOM ][ Level... On the planet Pascala on top of Mt. Integer, off the second coast of Firspro, dwells an awesome power known as... R U R Q T A ! ! ! Known to take the form of a CyberDemon, Rurqta rules the land under his iron hoof, and presides on top of a huge tower guarded by many of his finest soliders. Only the most experienced fighters have been known to even make it to the halfway point before being destroyed in an udderly painful way. You have been dumped on the mountain by the Legion of Bastards for their initiation ceremony. Survive, and you're inducted. Die, and you'll be...dead. (WOW!) <RURQTA can only been seen on Ultra-Violence or Nightmare mode.>",
