	"description": "This is a pretty fast-paced deathmatch level. It was made for 2 players. I haven't tested 4 players. There is a floating cube on this level and the cube has no gliches. I didn't make the cube the same way as the author of FLOATCUB. It should be a very good level for anyone. This level is a need for everyone!",
