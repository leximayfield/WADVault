	"description": "This is my first released map. It's a random tech base level with medium length and difficulty. I took inspiration from Doom, Doom 2 and TNT Evilution maps. Since it's a vanilla map, you can play it as intended or with your favourite mod (e.g. Complex Doom, Brutal Doom, etc), but expect some balance issues if you play with a mod.",
