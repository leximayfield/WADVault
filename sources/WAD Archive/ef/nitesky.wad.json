	"description": "Piloting your private plane across the barren wastelands of an almost deserted Earth, you reflect on a job well done after defeating those hideous creatures and twisted humans in Doom, Doom ][, And Quake. Landing in a small town you stop at an nearly empty tavern and order a dinner and beer. To pass the time until your dinner arrives you talk to the only other occupant, a tall weathered old mountain man. He tells you the recent rumors of strange things happening in the nearby hills to the North. Erie lites in the nite sky and strange sounds heard from distant peaks. He said they were probably just the next town 100 miles to the north or from a gang of bandits and outlaws that used to hideout in those northern hills. After you eat your dinner you decide to find out what really is up in those hills.",
