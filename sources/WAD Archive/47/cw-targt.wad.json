	"description": "So, you think you are a whizz with Doom's weaponry? Think again, hot-shot! Take my clay pidgeon target practice, and get to work on random, small, fast moving targets! For EDGE, I've given all the standard Doom weapons an alternate-attack which throws a clay target - see if you can hit it before it touches the ground. It's that simple. A high pitched \"Bing!\" will signify a hit, while a low pitched \"bzzt!\" will mean you suck real bad : )",
