	"description": "Into Hell is intended to be an episode of levels that take you deeper and deeper underground, until you find a crack in the Earth and dive into the realm itself. BUT... this was originally going to be a 11 maps. Then my comp. got a virus and I didn't touch Doom for about 3-4 weeks. There'll be a part 2, I hope. Not for a while, but there will be. I'm still trying to get a handle on mapping, and the last 2 maps aren't like anything I've tried before, so I hope they turned out okay. Anyhow, hope you enjoy! The story is provided in the level descriptions.",
