	"description": "This is a deathmatch only level for DOOM I designed with the altdeath mode in mind. It is a smallish level without the chainsaw, plasma rifle, or BFG. What it does feature is good solid deathmatch action (what else?). It has been extensively playtested with 2-4 players and has gone through a few revisions to arrive at its current state.",
