	"description": "The Mountain King built his fortress in the heart of a grim, snowy peak, thinking it to be unassailable, but his pride was misplaced and his land was overrun by horrible creatures, all the way to his mighty throne. Lost and weary, you have been searching for an exit to the caverns you were exploring when you stumble upon the ruins of the Mountain King's Domain, and they are anything but quiet... A Heretic level designed for vanilla/chocolate with some rather large areas. Expect some chaos to break out on hard mode. There are also plenty of secrets to find.",
