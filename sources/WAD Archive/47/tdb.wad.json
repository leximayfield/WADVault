Having gotten sick of you, the demons grabbed you after one of your battles and threw you into a portal leading to this new evil place. But before you start your escape from it, the story first starts on a yet another army base under attack from the demons. You must fight your way through it. ------------------------------------------------- This is the first map out of 6 for a new episode of Doom 2 I will be making. It has a base theme and is for zdoom. It is fairly tought but not too tough.",
