	"description": "Brown and Gray, lots of monsters. My fourth wad, and the first one where I paid very close attention to textures and texture alignment. COOL level. Very hard, but is just fun to run through. Spends a lot of time outside, and has a stairway to the basement of DOOM. Has a demo, so just sit and watch if you get stuck.",
