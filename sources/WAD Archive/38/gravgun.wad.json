	"description": "I was browsing the ZDoom forums when I saw people adamantly stating that you could never make anything like the gravity gun in ZDoom. So I made one. It works more or less just like the HL2 gravity gun. \"Pick up / drop\" defaults to E and \"shoot\" is bound to \"R\" although you can change it in the options.",
