	"description": "Three fairly small, arena style levels to get the heart pumping in the ritual combat of two player, head- to-head deathmatch. You won't have to play for twenty minutes searching through some sh*tty, gigantic map trying to find your opponent (who probably turns out to be a dirty, lame camper anyway). Designed purely with two players in mind, these maps will have you and a friend(??) duking it out like a couple of nude mud-wresters on a daytime chat show. But it ain't all \"rocket launcher in a phone box\" style combat -- you'll need a bit of skill too.",
