	"description": "A highly concentrated map with over 400 enemies, do not be discouraged though, you can mow through them relatively quickly as they're mostly low-tier enemies while you have weapons up to the rocket launcher slot, plus barrels on your side. This was played by Vargskelethor on one of his streams for his contest, he did not like it as much however, because he was too casual with it, so there's two casual easy difficulties named after Joel for people of his caliber.",
