	"description": "This wad is third of 17 levels of a large wad not uploaded yet called \"LORDDOOM.WAD\". The setting and the middle of this level is a courtyard and a bridge traversing the center of it. You must cross the bridge to start your search for the switch which allows you access to the red key. Easier said than done unless you know how to use your fists and a chainsaw. You might need them.",
