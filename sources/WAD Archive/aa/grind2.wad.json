	"description": "The first in an almost-vanilla set of levels. No port effects are used, but a good port is required to run the wad. Be on the lookout for the simple fake slopes, the fake 3D floors, and the fake mirror. The demos show a walkthrough of the level on easy mode. Demos find 0% secrets, so no surprises are given away.",
