	"description": "Welcome to Castle Tazmania. This is a DOOM ][ Level designed primarily for deathmatch play. I took great care to choose textures appropriately for all rooms, and I also spent a lot of time aligning the textures to make the secrets a little harder to find. (I cannot abide those who throw something together in an hour without even trying to align textures, and then expect us to play it). I am especially proud of the walls in the spiral staircase. A lesser man would have left the venetian-blind effect there because it was so much trouble to correct. I always enjoy watching perfectly matched walls go by as I'm running full speed, guns a-blazin'.",
