	"description": "In 1976, an archaeologist found a very strange ancient temple in the Iranian desert. Scientists then researched the temple and found a gateway teleporter to it. When they entered it, everything was empty but they found a portal. They have been constructing devices everywhere to make the portal work. Everything worked, except demons spawned from the portal and invaded the temple. Now you have to kill the demons and see what's inside the portal!",
