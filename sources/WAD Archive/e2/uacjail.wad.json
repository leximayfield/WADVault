	"description": "For ten years the whereabouts of the Doom Space Marine were unknown. Following Hell on Earth he simply vanished, leaving the Quake Marine to defend Earth from the forces of evil. In the year 2145 he finally returned, with the rank of Corporal, to do battle with the demons that threatened to overrun Mars City. But where had he gone? Why was he absent for so long when his skills were needed the most? Official UAC spokespeople maintained that he was unavailable for mental health reasons, and after securing Mars City for the second time he was quickly and quietly retired, with strict orders not to discuss either of his missions or the missing years in between. The truth, it seemed, had been buried.",
