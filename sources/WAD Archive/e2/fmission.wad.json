	"description": "The contact to the research station on Pluto is lost. Our Marine has to interrupt his holiday and must fly to Pluto. During the flight, he falls asleep. When he wakes up, his team already explore the station. Thats the story or completely different. My first map. Mostly weak weapons & monsters. Custom monsters. Very few monsters with the element of tightness. I guess i was influence by Quake 4 singleplayer which means linearity and frontal attacks. Recommend is the use of a GLRender.",
