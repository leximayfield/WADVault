	"description": "You were but broken bones and brawny blood. Yet your tomb stirs, and here you stand! This was a map I created for the Vinesauce Mapping Contest a few months back. After the stream where Joel played through it people had started asking for the download link, so I decided to just release it now. It's mostly unchanged from the one submitted to the contest, the only difference is it has a titlepic this time around.",
