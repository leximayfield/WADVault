I recommend you play in deathmatch mode and if you are tough enough also with the -respawn option provided with DooM. The level has some small bugs, but... who cares. It\u00efs nothing too worse, just some halls of mirror. It is no too hard level and the switch to open the exit is secured by a sole baron. So, if you wonna get through very fast: Just kill him, push the button and EXIT, but what would be the point in leaving this fast?",
