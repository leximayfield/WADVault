The only known bug does NOT ALLOW TO SAVE your game That obliges not to do only one mistake. Well, the aim is not to kill all monsters of this level, but to SURVIVE. I highly recommend you to try it in skill 1, to learn how this level works. Skill 3 is for very good doomists, and skill 4 is possible but very very hard... it's time for you to learn hummility!!!",
