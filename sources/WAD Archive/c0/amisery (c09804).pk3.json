	"description": "This map was included in my huge project 'TGRDM3'(Morgenstern) that originally started back in 2007, but I finally decided to kill the project on the 26 October 2014. The development time was going to take several more years to complete, and making maps that uses 3D Objects - heavily - on a 2.5 game engine is overly complicated along with its limitations. Abandoned Misery was originally half-way designed back in 2010, but later completely redesigned in 2013 (which is the version released). I honestly believe that this is the first - real successful Deathmatch map I have ever created in my entire history of Doom modding. Call me bias, but I have rejected approximately 37 maps that I have created for the TGRDM3 project, but this map is one of the survivors in the new stock set. I hope others enjoy this map and possibly use it for other projects.",
