	"description": "This is a first time try at building a level from scratch. It was mainly built for deathmatch play but found that it is great for a 1 player game. The name is \"CAREFUL\" for a very good reason. There are alot of secret passages, so keep hunting - all is not what it seems. ;-) Please let me know if there are any problems encountered. See ya on the other side.",
