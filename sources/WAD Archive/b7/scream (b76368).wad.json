	"description": "This level is made with co-op and Deathmatchers in mind, with varied terrain and viewpoints from which to snipe friends and enemies alike. An area of mineshafts and tunnels coupled with very intricate layouts make this a very challenging level. Not suited for solo only because one of the keys requires two players to locate. (HINT) For co-op, several areas require teamwork to clear, especially in locating the keys, or in seeing how switches alter the layout. Search and explore!",
