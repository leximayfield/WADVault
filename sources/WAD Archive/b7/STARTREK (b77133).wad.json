	"description": "This Wad is for DOOM ][ only. Based on the Startrek TNG TV series, it includes all new grafix and sounds and is designed loosely around the configuration of the NCC-1701D Enterprise. We'd like to think that it's almost like being there. I started it because I wanted to have some kind of focus for my next wad, so being a Startrek fan I thought that would be a good idea. It was NEVER originally supposed to be as huge a progect as it turned out to be, but every time I worked on it I thought of another cool idea for it (grin).",
